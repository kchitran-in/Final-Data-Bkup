# Introduction
This wiki explains the design and implementation of pdf players for mobile devices.. 

[KN-17 System JIRA](https:///browse/KN-17)


## Background:
 As of now we are experiencing content players player as part of the sunbirded mobile app , to make our building block independent and to test mobile specific features we need mobile build to test with minimal capabilities. 


## Problem Statement:
how to verify resolution and alignments of content players in mobile devices. 


## Key design problems:

* How to launch the content player in new ionic app


* how to generate APK ?


* How can we push content player changes to APK ?


* How to play(online & offline) the content in mobile  ?


* how to pull the latest changes of the content(content versions)


* How to verify the telemetry events  


* How to distribute APK to tester 




## Solution1:

Design: 


![](images/storage/Flowcharts%20(1).png)
## Solution:

* We are using the ionic framework to render the player and its[link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli).


* using ionic version of 6.1.9 and node js version is 14 onwards


* We can have players like pdf ,video and epub and we can implement different components each.


* In the players list component we can have the list of the players


* In the content list component we can have hardcoded list contents as of now , based on player selected in player list component


* We can have new version of apk to get latest changes.


* The player component will load the player with selected content from the list.


* The player component will be integrated with respected players and the pdf player will be integrated in the pdf player component and follow the[steps](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player#pdf-player-library-for-sunbird-platform).


* We can have an apk link in the microsite so that it will be accessible to testers and adopters.



 **Pros:** 
* Its easy to implement 


* we can have different components for different players 



 **Cons:** 
* We are supporting only landscape mode , not supporting portrait mode


* As of now we are rendering a contents list from hardcoded data.

    




## Solution2:

## design:
![](images/storage/Flowcharts%20-%20Page%202.png)
## Solution:

* We are using the ionic framework to render the player and its[link](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli).


* using ionic version of 6.1.9 and node js version is 14 onwards


* We can have one landing component , it has the explore button


* After clicking on explore button , opening the [knowledge portal](https://dev.knowlg.sunbird.org/) application in mobile app using in app browser [plug](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/in-app-browser/#angular) in provided by ionic framework.



 **Pros:** 
* Its easy to implement 


* We can explore all the content players like pdf, epub and video


* Faster the development process.


* Any fixes or changes in portal will impact easily in mobile app.  



 **Cons:** 
* The knowledge portal is not responsive so it will impact the same here.


* Knowledge portal also has the editors link so those we need handle in mobile view.


* If portal application is down , then mobile app also will not work.






## Solution3: 
We can use existing [sunbird mobile application](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app) as the one more approach 

 **Pros:** 
* Its easy to implement 


* We can easily change players version and test our changes 


* Faster the development process.



 **Cons:** 
* have some predefined forms in mobile app and on boarding configuration, those forms configurations are not there in our building block.


* if we want use existing mobile app as it is we need have/follow these[ installations steps](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/developer-docs/mobile-app-installation/).


* If we use existing mobile app as it is, so any changes in [configurations](http://docs.sunbird.org/latest/developer-docs/mobile-app-installation/mobile_app_forms/index.html) or api’s , will through error if we not onboard those new changes.


* if we want use latest versions of the mobile app ,  then we to make related changes in that version in our building block(configuration , api’s).


* If we don’t want some of other modules , then cleaning up of existing code is very difficult. 


* The app size will be more as we use existing mobile application because it has lot of modules.






## Solution4: 

* We need to use existing knowlg portal application 


* In this application we need create 3 modules to it. and which are portal related one module, mobile related changes in one module , and the common changes are into common/shared module.


* For portal related changes into portal module and along with shared module when we build portal related changes only comes. 


* Similarly , for mobile related changes into mobile module and along with shared module when we build mobile  related changes only comes.


* The shared module having changes which are shared between portal and mobile application.
