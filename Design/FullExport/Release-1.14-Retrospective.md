Retrospective

Add your Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing items to the table below. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.



| Start doing | Stop doing | Keep doing | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| <ul><li>Team Standup meetings must start</li><li>Build must come on time, if not communication must be sent out in case of delay</li><li>Communication to QA that build has been deployed and the scope for testing has also to be mentioned </li><li>Unit test coverage with in the teams </li><li>Teams need to upskill to write unit test within the budgeted time</li><li>Simplification of Jira Work flow</li><li>Can action items from retrospective action items be collated for tracking ?</li><li>Pre-prod to PROD deployment must improve. Smoke test validations on PROD must improve</li><li>One channel (SPgM) for inputs to TMs for features/tech items</li><li>Simplify what we are implementing. Eg: Urdu related story, Add video was dropped </li><li>Design discussions with DC must happen more often </li><li>Teams must understand the other modules (technically) to be able to understand how the dependency is being met </li><li>Jira must be used to record key decisions</li><li>TMs must take a call before the sprint starts if the story is ready to be taken up by the team</li><li>TMs, PMs, team members must understand the Jira workflow status move</li><li>Callouts from DC and TMs on feature to be taken up or not upfront</li><li>Interaction between Tech Managers and DC must happen early on</li><li>Analysis of initial vs actual estimates for TMs  and PMs</li><li>Run through the Roadmap to the tech teams early on by PMs to help understand the business need and value</li><li>Start calling out issues early on by dev teams</li><li>UX and Tech teams (DC, TMs) must collaborate more closely and often to bring out issues early on</li><li>Can releases go out with whatever features are ready to go ?</li></ul><ul><li>Start focusing on the outcome of the release</li></ul><ul><li>Team wise retrospective sprint wise</li><li>Can every week task/items that is being slipped communicated to PMs ?</li></ul> | <ul><li>Resource allocation in JIRA.</li><li>Dates related to QA planning without understanding the requirements in scope for the release</li><li>Work allocation tracking in Jira was stopped and moved to google sheet (CF Team)</li><li>Features coming in between sprints leading to scope creep and delays. Eg..?</li><li>Testing efforts within teams must improve. QA can test issues in pre-prod which are existing prod defects</li><li>Variable tracking sheet in excel for deployment is not a good practice</li><li>Old releases still showing Jira tickets that are not in closed status</li><li>Too many deployments, must combine deployments or a regular deployment cadence</li><li>Reduce the iterations for design reviews</li><li>Discussion on Jira stories must be avoided and not used as slack chat.</li><li>Most of the issues that came in 1.14 where production existing issues that could have been planned and fixed in time.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Continue unit test case writing to improve code coverage  + 1</li><li>Improvement to the Functional test suite for SB Platform must continue</li><li>Work related to stability of the product and NFR must continue + 1</li><li>TMs has got access to GIT repo to verify deployment variables</li><li>Story descriptions getting update regularly and not limited only comments by the PMs</li><li>Deliberate Communication to the stakeholders</li><li>Communication - Decision oriented and sharp also targeted towards decision making</li><li>SoS has helped in understanding the dependencies</li><li>Information of items that are being moved out a sprint /release</li><li>QA Team - Getting lot more calls to understand the requirements to PMs</li><li>Interaction between Tech Managers and DC must happen early on</li></ul> |
