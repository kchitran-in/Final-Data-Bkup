Preferred node version -




```
"node": "12.16.1",
"npm": "6.13.4"
```
Clear your node cache -




```
npm cache clean --force 
```
Delete node_modules from client and app folder and have fresh npm i -




```
rm -rf node_modules/  // for client and app folders followed by 
npm install 
```
If you are upgrading from some previous version of node try to rebuild which will recompile all your C++ addons with the new binary -




```
npm rebuild 
```
If you still face issues make your system compatible with new c++ libraries hence have build-essentials in ur system (GCC/g++ compilers and libraries and some other utilities). To use C/C++ compiler, you just need to install build-essential package on your machine.




```
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```
If you face issues with node-gyp delete the previously version and install again -




```
rm -rf ~/.node-gyp
npm install
npm i -g node-gyp
node-gyp build
```
If you face issue with node-sass rebuild it with forcefully or you may chose to reinstall it -




```
npm rebuild node-sass --force
```
If you face issues with bindings delete the current version and install the latest version (hope you never use this).




```
npm install bindings
```
