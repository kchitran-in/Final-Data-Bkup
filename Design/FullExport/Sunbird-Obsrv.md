 **BUILDING BLOCK “APPLIANCE”** 

 Goal: Simplify Obsrv usage for adopters - provision for an ‘appliance-like’ simplicity and ease-of-use when it comes to setting up, configuring and operating the building block/ solution




*  **Set Up ** 


    * Installation (single click install already enabled)


    * List Prerequisites on microsite (Adopters to be familiar with - Kubernetes, API usage …. etc.. )


    * Installation documentation to be migrated from Github to the microsite - new installation page for 2.0 on the microsite



    
*  **Configure** 


    * For my domain (domain agnostic default config enabled - for up to 1M events a day + configs for scale/ cost are available)


    * Configuration documentation to be migrated from Github to the microsite - new Obsrv 2.0 configs page on microsite



    
*  **Operate** 


    * ‘How-To’ guide for common usage (How do I configure a new data source, How do I generate a new chart, How do I compute an aggregate etc.) 


    * FAQs to be added to microsite - commonly occurring issues and their solutions + link to support



    
*  **New Versions for Obsrv Open Source?** 


    * [Obsrv open source roadmap](https://obsrv.sunbird.org/learn/product-roadmap) - driven by feature parity needs as compared to other industry offerings.


    * Items to be done from Use/ Configure/ Operate above will be added to the Obsrv roadmap.



    
*  **Context for open source Obsrv 2.0 - who do we target?** 


    * What are the solutions being targeted? (end-to-end data platform > B2B)


    * What is the scope of the solutions - who is it for? (large enterprises, nations)


    * Managed service offering - for smaller orgs (not open source)



    





 **OBSRV TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION**
