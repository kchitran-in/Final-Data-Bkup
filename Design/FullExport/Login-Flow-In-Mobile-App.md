## Current Implementation:

* Launch the keyclock login page using the custom tab
* Continue self signup and google login with custom tab
* When user clicks on state login then closing the custom tab and launch the inapp browser.


## Solution:
Solution 1:
* Launch the login page using the inapp browser.
* Continue self signup and state login with inapp browser
* When user clicks on Google login/signup then close the inapp browser and launch the google login with CustomTab by listening the callback URL on click.

Solution 2:
* List all the option (Signin, Login with Google, State Login, Manual Signup) in app.
* If user clicks on  **Signin**  then launch the Keyclock page with  **inapp browser** .
* If user clicks on  **State Login**  then launch the state login page with  **inapp browser** .
* If user clicks on  **Signup**  then launch the signup page with  **inapp browser** .
* If user clicks on **Login with Google**  then launch the Keyclock page with  **custom tab** .

Solution 3:
* List all the option (Signin, Login with Google, State Login, Manual Signup) in app.
* If user clicks on  **Signin**  then launch the Keyclock page with  **inapp browser** .
* If user clicks on  **State Login**  then launch the state login page with  **inapp browser** .
* If user clicks on  **Signup**  then handle signup flow in app.
* If user clicks on **Login with Google**  then handle in app using Google plugin.


## Pros and Cons:


| Solution | Pros | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | <ul><li>Minor changes in the keyclock page and in app.</li><li>If later we want to remove any option then there are no build deployment is required for app.</li><li>Common code base for Mobile and Portal.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Need to handle the callback to switch between inapp browser and custom tab based on selected option.</li></ul> | 
| 2 | <ul><li>No need to handle the callback to switch between inapp browser and custom tab.</li></ul> |  | 
| 3 | <ul><li>By implementing the manual signup and google login in app will have more control on flow.</li></ul> |  | 


## Conclusion:
Solution 1 is suggested by the design council.
