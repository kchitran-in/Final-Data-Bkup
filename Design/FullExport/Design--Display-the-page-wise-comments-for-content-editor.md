Solution 1:
1.  **Read all the  Comment of the content** 


* The plugin to display the comments related to each stage id.
* Do API Call to get all the comments associated with the Content Id.


```
{

"request": {

"contextDetails": {

"contentId": "do_123",

"version": "2",

"contentType": "ecml",

"stageId":""

}

}

}
```

* For the current Stage id, display the comments, if available.
* If there are no comments, then comments tab can show the message 'No reviewer comments'.
* On click of the stage, filter the results by stageid in comments result and show in the relevant comments.



 **API url** :

/review/comment/v1/read/comment

 **As per the response of the comments, all comment is available in array, **

}

]

},

"ts": "2018-10-22T06:00:39.012Z",

"ver": "1.0"

}
```


 **2. Delete the Comment by StageId** 

 **Api url: ** 

   /review/comment/v1/delete/comment

Request of the Delete of the comment by stageId is 


```
{

"request":{

"contextDetails":{

"contentId":"do_112623007469944832113",

"contentVer":"0",

"contentType":"application/vnd.ekstep.ecml-archive",

"stageId":"xyz"

}

}

}
```
The comments of the stageId: 'xyz' will be deleted.

 **Pros** 

On configuring the plugin, the comments are displayed.

 **Cons** 

Reviewer name and logo will be displayed same as when the reviewer commented. If the reviewer updates the name or logo it will not reflect in the old comments.

Solution 2
* To display the comments of a stage, for 'stage: select' event, do the API call for each stage id, 


```
{

"request": {

"contextDetails": {

"contentId": "do_123",

"version": "2",

"contentType": "ecml",

"stageId":"1"

}

}

}
```
 **Cons** 

The number of API calls will be more in case of more slides.



\*\*\*Solution 1 is accepted for development, which will have single api call to get all the comments for the content.
