### Problem Statement
Till release 2.0.0, LMS service was used for all the flows i.e. user, org, course batch, toc etc. There is a need to separate the LMS service to be used for flows related to course, batch, pages, toc etc.

[SB-12310 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-12310)



Solution Approach

To achieve the separation below are the major steps needs to be taken


* Restructuring of sunbird-utils
* sunbird-utils in maven central repo (or private repo)
* Cleaning of lms service to hold routes and flows related to lms only.
* Removal of gitmodules strategy as it is tightly coupled (service → mw → utils)
* Code refactoring and restructuring in sunbird-lms-mw

Restructuring of sunbird-utilssunbird-utils needs to hold specific core components which is leveraged by other services. For that purpose sunbird-utils is restructured as below. some of the components are renamed to specify it's purpose.

New structure is as below
