## Introduction:
This document describes the design approach of creating and switching of Managed User’s account 


## Background:
Jira Issue: [https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-68](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-68)

[https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-95](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-95)

Epic: [https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-67](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-67)

Presently only user having email address or phone number can register and use application. 


## Problem Statement:

1. How managed user account can be created.


1. How to switch between different managed user account and user account.




## Key design problems:

1. How to map actions performed by managed user to his account.

    Telemetry should be mapped with different user ID.


1. Device ID will be same for user and managed user.




## Existing workflow:
User login in to his account and starts using application.

 **Change request:** As part of  [https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-68](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SH-68) user should be able to switch and create profiles.

## Solution 1: 
Create separate session - 1. User session

                                                2. Managed user session.

Both sessions should reference to each other internally.

It can be handled via 2 different approaches - 


* Creating sub session and adding a pre-fix for all the routes which will generate 2 session ID.


* Create and maintain 2 session objects referencing to userId 



 **Pros** :  


1. 



 **Cons** : 


1. Maintaining multiple sessions could be cumbersome and lead to errors.


1. Adding prefix to routes could be extra work.




## Solution 2: 
Once switch profile is initiated fetch the managed user profile details. Replace the user data in session keeping the parent token as it is. 

![](images/storage/Untitled%20Diagram%20(3).jpg)Things to reinitialise  -  


* Telemetry 


* User profile


* Update UserId in elements in index.html

    "noOfMembers": 5,
    "status": 1
  }
}
```
 **Pros** :  


1. Simple to do.



 **Cons** : 


1. Managing session data each time when profile is switched.


1. Session ID remains same for user and managed user profile.








## Solution 3: 


![](images/storage/Untitled%20Diagram%20(9).jpg)

Things to reinitialise  -  


* Telemetry 


* User profile


* Update UserId and session ID in elements in index.html 



 **Challenges :** 


* Securing switch user API as it can generate token/login any user.


* Securing API for mobile as mobile will generate token from portal



 **Notes**  - 


* 2 user ID current user and switching user id should be send.


* Verifying user id after fetching details



 **Things to discuss**  - 


* Storing session id and mapping it with User Id in cassandra (where portal store sessions)  


* Cassandra TTL might delete the other mapped data (not sure NOC team says they dont add explicit TTL currently).  


* Fetch user details should give details of parent if parent exists


* How to do in mobile


* How mobile will support offline swtich (as switch requires to generate token)




## Conclusion

* Team to follow Solution 2.


* Parent’s token will be used and child’s token will not be generated.


* Session data to be updated with child user profile data. Just changing the session data is required no need to change cookie and generate new session.


* Re initialisation of telemetry server and user service.
