## 

Integrate the chatbot client library
create a new simple angular application or use any existing angular app to integrate chatbot client



Step 1: Install the package (install from local dist folder by giving full relative path)


```js
npm i sunbird-chatbot-client --save 
```


Step 2: Import the modules and components

Import the NgModule for each component you want to use:

import { ChatLibModule, ChatLibService } from '@project-sunbird/chatbot-client-v8';

@NgModule({
    ...
    
    imports: [ChatLibModule],
    
    ...
})
```


Step 3: Add the library component to the HTML page


```
<lib-chat-window [inputValues]="botConfig"></lib-chat-window>
```
botConfig properties:
```
