 **Bundling Katex Library only when Math Formula is used in Question.** 

 **Existing Behavior** :

Currently, we are generating the QuestionSet ECML by using BasePlugin 'toECML' function, So we were bundling every Dependency by comparing String of QuestionBody.data.



 **Approach:** 

Stage-manager.js in content-editor,

Apply filter on toECML on stage-manager of content-editor, we have plugin object containing the questionBody, 


* Validation of question whether having math formula or not, using questionBody object which contains question text compare whether having 'data-math' && 'math-text'.

JSON.parse(plugin._question.body).data.data.question.text


*  Validation of Question-options whether having math formula or not, using questionBody which contain


    *  **MTF**  question contain:  **optionsLHS**  &  **optionsRHS**  on questionBody


    *  **MCQ**  questions contain:  **options**  or  **sentence** (Reordering questions)


    *  **FTB**  questions contain:  **answer** objects

    apply filter for each options(MCQ), sentence(MCQ), answer(FTB), optionLHS & optionRHS containing  'data-math' && 'math-text'.



    

Once we validated having  'data-math' && 'math-text' on questions and options, we enable or disable 

katex libraries on ECML. If  'data-math' && 'math-text' is available in questions or options we are enable them to load on manifest dependency on ECML, if they are not, removing Katex libraries from manifest dependency on ECML.
