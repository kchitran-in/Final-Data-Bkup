OverviewDifferent kinds of collaboration possible


* Real-time, syncronous
* Threaded conversations, asyncronous
* Q&A, asyncronous

This doc covers the functional interface which must be implemented by messaging services to allow its real-time synchronous collaboration capability to be exposed within Sunbird.

The functional interface will provide an implementation of the Sunbird abstractions which enable sending and receiving of messages.

ArchitectureSunbird provides plugin points for installing 


1. a messaging interface for clients
1. a messaging service adapter which can connect with a messaging service backend. 

The Sunbird client (web/mobile) will install a client plugin allowing it to connect to the messaging backend via the messaging interface exposed by the Sunbird server. 

![Architecture for Messaging Service Integration](images/storage/Sunbird%20Messaging%20Integration.jpg)

EntitiesThe messaging interface provides an abstraction over messaging services to enable one-or-more messaging providers to plug-in to Sunbird. The interface provides the means to manipulate and manage:




*  **Participants** : each participant in a group messaging session is associated with an account. Consider three types of accounts: user, guest and bot
*  **Identity** : each user account will be associated with a Sunbird identity, it can also be associated with other third-party identities
*  **Rooms** : equivalent of a group chat. Multiple accounts can participate in a room
*  **Sessions** : are associated with devices which the participant uses. Multiple sessions may be initiated from a single device
*  **Events** : are an abstraction over forms of content. A message is one event type.
*  **Devices** : provide a means for offline management of encryption keys. A device is not always a physical entity, a browser is also a device

Participant managementFor a participant to send/receive messages, she/he/it must be registered with the messaging service. Registered participants must authenticate to interact with the service and perform operations.

Register: POST /msg/client/v1/register?medium=<medium>?type=<type>Register a user account with profile details using the messaging backend chosen by the instance administrator.


* This API may be used to register two types of user accounts (see Registering Bots for details on registering bot accounts)
* Once the registration is successful, the server must issue the client an authenticatedUserToken which must be used in subsequent API calls from this device
* The server will attempt to generate an account with the provided username, however, if the username is not available, the server will return a corresponding error. 
* The selected username must conform to the constraints specified below, if it does not meet the constraints, the server will return a corresponding error.

Login: POST /msg/client/v1/loginAuthenticates a user using an authentication method from:


* Mobile number/OTP
* OIDC identity
* Username/one-time use token

The client first makes an empty login request which will return a 401 Unauthorised response and a sessionId in the response body. The client then uses this sessionId in subsequent requests to complete the login sequence.

Once the user has been authenticated, the server should issue the user an authenticatedUserToken which can be used for future authorization needs (eg: when making API calls).

Request

| Parameter | Type | Description | 
|  _JSON Body Parameters_  | 
| sessionId | Int | The id of the login session initiated. A new sessionId can be generated by sending an empty request.  **_Required_**  | 
| type | Enum | The type of authentication protocol to use.  **_Required_** Can be one of org.sunbird.msg.login.otp, org.sunbird.msg.login.oidc, org.sunbird.msg.login.token | 
| identity | IdentityObject | Identity information for the user who is logging in.  **_Required_**  | 
| identity.medium | Enum | The medium of the identity which is being passed.  **_Required_** Can be one of [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).email, [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).phone, [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).oidc | 
| identity.address | String | The identity address of the user who is logging in. Required when identity.medium is [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).email, [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).phone | 
| identity.uri | String | The identity URI for authenticating the user who is logging in. Required when identity.medium is [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).oidc | 
| token | String | The one-time use token to confirm the user’s identity. Required when type is org.sunbird.msg.login.otp or org.sunbird.msg.login.token | 

Login with OTPTo login using an OTP, the client sets the type parameter to org.sunbird.msg.login.otp, the identity.medium to org.sunbird.msg.id.phone and identity.address to the recipient’s phone number. The token is the OTP requested using the validate identity endpoint.

Login via token is analogous to login via OTP with the type and medium being set appropriately. The token can be received via any communication channel.

 _Example_ 
```
POST /msg/client/v1/login

Content-type: application/json

{

    “sessionId”: 9817263

    “type”: “org.sunbird.msg.login.otp”,

    “identity”: {

        “medium”: “org.sunbird.msg.id.phone”,

        “address”: “+919999000111”,

    },

    “token”: “SB-419817”,

}
```
Login with OIDCTo login using an OIDC Identity Provider (IdP), the client sets the type parameter to org.sunbird.msg.login.oidc, the identity.medium to [org.sunbird.msg.id](http://org.sunbird.msg.id).oidc and identity.uri to the OIDC Authorization Request URI.

If the server allows logging in via the IdP selected, it redirects the client to visit the OIDC Authorization Request URI (via the appropriate HTTP response). The server should encode a callback endpoint into the Authorization Request URI. 

The client presents the user with the OAuth2 consent page allowing access to the user’s identity information. 

If the user authorises the request, the IdP will redirect the client to the redirect_uri along with an auth code. The redirect_uri should have been set to point to a server endpoint which acts as a confidential OIDC client. The server uses the auth code to request an access token from the IdP and retrieve the user’s identity information. This completes the OIDC login flow.

Once the OIDC login flow is completed on the server, the client makes a subsequent request to the login endpoint with the same sessionId and receives a success response.


*  Initiating the OIDC request


```
POST /msg/client/v1/login

Content-type: application/json

Room (Channel/Group) managementCreate a room: POST /msg/client/v1/room/event/createThis endpoint creates a new room where subsequent events and messages can be dispatched. Room creation is itself an event which is the origin of subsequent events in the room. The room contains Sunbird metadata which can be used for discovery. 

Rooms have two additional settings which control membership of the room. First is visibility which determines if the room is visible in public listings of the rooms available. The second is joinability which determines if the room can be joined without an invitation.
