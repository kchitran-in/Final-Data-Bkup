 **Overview** As, most of the users will be doing self sign-up into the sunbird platform, all users will by default belong to default organisation/channel, i.e. Custodian channel. Currently, we do not allow to change the user's root organisation from update user api. As, most user will be now created through self sign-up we need a way to change user's root-org, so that user can be associated with state's root-org, and contribute in the platform based on membership.

 **Solution approaches**  **Approach 1** Allow updating the root org from update user API.



| Pros | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| Using the same API, so no new API need to be introduced | Role having user-update will be able to carry out the operation, so role cannot be seperated | 
|  | Will add and make current business logic and make update method more complex | 

 **Approach 2** Provide additional API to update the user's root-org



| Pros | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| More control on user-role management, we can restrict API access | Introducing new API, one more end-point | 
| Better managed from code-design perspective. |  | 


### API Design

```text
{
  "request": {
    "userId" : "id-of-user-to-migrate",
    "rootOrg": "newRootOrg",
    "roles" : ["role1","role2"], //Optional - default just public role
    "organisation" : ["org1", "org2"] //Optional - Roles will be applicable to rootOrg, if nothing passed
  }
}

```
 **Open doubts:** 
*  **  ** Which role user will have above api call access?
*   Does caller need to have same role under newly proposed moved org or he can be part of any rootOrg.

 **Complete solution/Change required for successful root-org migration**  **Check's and warnings for user before proceeding** 
* User needs to be shown warning for current suborg membership/roles that user holds if any, will be removed.
* User needs to be shown warning for enrolled courses, that belong to previous root-org, having status "Not Started" or "In Progress"
* User should be asked to un-enroll or complete such courses, before executing root-org migration.

 **Actions to be executed for successful migration** 
* While fetching courses, if there is any filtering based on root-org, that needs to be removed, while showing user completed courses. (Within sunbird core level there are no business logic for user-course association related to root-org)
* Remove user_org association, which are invalid according to new root-org to be associated.
