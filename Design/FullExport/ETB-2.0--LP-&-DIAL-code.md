## Goals

* DIAL code request to be generated from the system using ETB editor.


## Background and strategic fit
Previously DIAL code request was made offline over email. Though the initial days this approach work perfectly fine (with champion states). As the number of partners (states) increases the offline request can't paces up with the growing request. 

Over a period of time, the ETB basic workflows have become stable and request for DIAL Codes is required to be in the system. 


## Assumptions

* Before ETB creation to start states channel and other on-boarding are done.
* ETB creator will have the reference of the book he wants to create and identify the places where DIAL codes are required.
* DIAL code will be generated in async mode and ETB Creator can download DIAL code images and distribute them to the DTP operator to place them in the physical copy.
* ETB DIAL code validation will be against the one created for the book.
* One DIAL code per marker


## Requirements


| # | Title | User Story | Component | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | ETB editor to have the DIAL code request marker. | ETB editor to have a UI element (boolean, True| False) against TB and TB unit to capture the request for DIAL Code required at that Textbook, section, Subsection level. [SB-7728 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7728)[SB-7729 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7729) | ETB Editor | 
| 2 |  Total number of DIAL code | After adding markers for the required DIAL code at TB, TB unit/ subsection at TB level, the total number of DIAL code request can be raised.

At TB level Total number of dial code required to be displayed. 

[SB-7959 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7959)

 |  ETB Editor | 
| 3 | Trigger the DIAL code request | User shall be able to see the total number of DIAL code require and trigger requested to generate the request number of DIAL codes.

[SB-7960 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7960)

 | ETB Editor | 
| 4 | Generate DIAL codes | LP shall create the requested number of DIAL codes,  create images using the DIAL codes and provide the download URL for all the images( URL zip packet of the images and CSV, mapping DIAL code and request marker title). Images should be DTP ready.

[SB-7962 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7962)

 | LP | 
| 5 | Request more DIAL code | ETB creator can request DIAL code again, by marking existing or adding new Section/ subsection. 

[SB-7964 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7964)

 | ETB Editor | 
| 6 | Regenerate the DIAL code  | LP shall regenerate the DIAL code for the updated request ( It should include previously generated DIAL code) for the ETB.

DIAL code API shall not reassign the DIAL code created for one ETB to other ETB request. A DIAL code once assigned to one ETB shall not be reassigned to another ETB.  

[SB-7965 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7965)

 | LP | 
| 7 | Verification for DIAL code | A CSV report generated by scanning the PDF/Physical copy should be used to verify the DIAL codes. Any DIAL code in the CSV outside of the allotted DIAL code should provide an appropriate error. Mismatch rectification can be done via LP APIs.

[SB-7967 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7967)

 | LP | 
| 8 | Design Task for ETB | [SB-7969 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-7969) | UX Design | 


## User interaction and design
TBD


## Questions
Below is a list of questions to be addressed as a result of this requirements document:



| Question | Outcome | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| Structured DIAL code request  | The request shall be made via the system.  | 
| DIAL code verification | DIAL code verification is done online using the CSV output from the verification app.  | 


## Not Doing

* One to one mapping of DIAL code with Marker.
* An auto arrangement of DIAL codes based on the verification report (CSV from verification app)
