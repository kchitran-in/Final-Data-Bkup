## Overview :
There are multiple user accounts created by states that have never been used/ been inactive for extended periods for time. As states move to officially onboard users (SSO, self sign up etc.), there is a need to clean up these legacy accounts.This will require a 'hard delete' so as to free up mobile numbers/ email IDs associated with them, if any.Active accounts for a state will be retained post validation with the state: Users who have created or created content, corse mentors, batch creators etc. will be retained in the system. [SB-10454](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-10454)  and [SB-10455](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-10455)


## Problem statement :
Since user details are spread across different systems and we need to remove it from all places. and same applicable for org as well.

Solution 1: Sunbird can expose an API to do user/org hard delete. Api structure will be as follow:


```js
Method : DELETE
URL: v1/data/delete
Request body :

 {
  "request": {
            "objectIds" : [],
            "objectType" : ""    
       }
   }

Response body: 
 {
    "id": "api.data.delete",
    "ver": "v1",
    "ts": "2019-02-06 05:21:18:948+0000",
    "responseCode": "OK",
    "result": {
        "response": {
            
        }
    }
}

```



## Solution 2:
 Sunbird will expose different end point to delete object based on object type. Api structure will be as follow:


```js
Method : DELETE
URL: v1/user/delete
Request body :

 {
  "request": {
            "userIds" : []  
       }
   }

Response body: 
 {
    "id": "api.user.delete",
    "ver": "v1",
    "ts": "2019-02-06 05:21:18:948+0000",
    "responseCode": "OK",
    "result": {
        "response": {
            
        }
    }
}

-- Similar it will have for org delete as well
URL: v1/org/delete
Request body :

 {
  "request": {
            "orgIds" : []  
       }
   }



```






Since this api will do all operations in background, it will do initial request validation and all other validation will be handle in background.



| Pros | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| Api will have more control on consumer  |  | 
| Easy to generate Audit logs |  | 
| Easy for consumer to invoke  |  | 
|  |  | 




## Solution 3 :
   Write an ETL job to preform same operations. ETL job will do following operations:





|   User | Organisation  | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| 
1. Find identifier of all those users, whom you want to delete.
1. Delete those users from Elasticsearch using ES delete api. 
1. in ES user need to delete from following index type (user,userprofilevisibility,usercourses,usernotes)
1.  Delete user from Keycloak, using keycloak delete end point
1. Delete user from cassandra : following tables will be involved (user,user_courses,user_skills,address, user_badge_assertion,user_org,usr_external_identity,user_job_profile,user_notes,user_education) 

 | 
1. Find org ids that need to be deleted
1. Delete organisation from elasticsearch
1.  Delete organisation details from cassandra. Data need to be deleted from following tables(organisation,user_org,org_external_identity,address)

 | 
|  |  | 





| Pros | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| Standalone job to perform this operation. |  Difficult to control caller , Ex: caller is not identified by sunbird | 
|  | Can't reuse it for later use case: Example: Org admin want's to delete some user or delete some of the org | 




## Solution 4 :
Provide sequence of CQL queries and curl command to do all above operations.
