* This branch will store the generated site
* Only the updated version folder will get updated.
* latest stable/ & 1.9 ( latest version no.) folder will be duplicate symlinked. 
* Purpose of creating latest/ folder is that if someone refers the latest URL somewhere, the user lands to latest docs always.
* the base url of each version will be the version folder.
    *  Eg - For `docs.sunbird.org/1.8/features/administrator/dashboard` will be `/1.8/`
    * The reason is it easy to understand docs team
