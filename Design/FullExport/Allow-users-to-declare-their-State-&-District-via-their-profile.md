  **Problem statement:  ** 

 As a sunbird user, one should be able to do declare their District (Choose State -> Choose District).

 **Proposed solution 1:** Storing the location of the user in separate table & separate API for updating location

 **Pros** : 


1. Implementation will not impact existing API for create/update

 **Cons** :


1. Data to be loaded from multiple calls to database.
1. Read user would require a flag to fetch whether location data is required by end-user or not.

 **DB changes ** New user_location table



| Column | Changes | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| id(Primary Key) | Auto generated | 
| userId | User Id of the user | 
| locationIds | Location id of the location selected by User (Eg. state locationId, district location id) | 

APIs Added


1. Update location  

     **POST  ** /user/v1/update/location
```
{
  "request": {

        "locationCode" : "locationCode"

    }

     }

     **Note** : User Id will be taken from "x-authenticated-user-token".  

    

     **Response** 
```
 **200 OK**  - Location of user is successfully stored 

 **401 Unauthorised  -**  In case user API is called without proper user-access token.

 **400 Bad Request -** Invalid location code or invalid type of location passed (only district is valid as of now)

 **Proposed solution 2:** Using the same table for storage and update using same API.

 **Pros:** 


1. Getting user location data will be available directly with user information.
1. We can create/update the location of user in Create/Update user request.

 **Cons:** 


1. Changes in current create/update API logic & extending the storage structure of existing tables.

 **DB changes **  user table changes



| Column | Changes | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| locationIds  | Added -  Location id of the location selected by User (Eg. state locationId, district location id) | 



APIs Added


1. Update location  

     **POST  ** /user/v1/create or /user/v1/update
```
{
  {
  "request": {

        "locationCode" : "locationCode"

       }

     }

    }

    
```
 **Note:**  Other parameter can be same as create/update  user request, we will add one more parameter to update the location

    

     **Response** 

 **200 OK**  - Location of user is successfully stored 

 **401 Unauthorised  -**  In case user API is called without proper user-access token.

 **400 Bad Request -** Invalid location type or invalid location id. (only code for location type district will be allowed)



 **Note** : User read api will return the location data as follows, for ease of display.

Read is made efficient by storing locationIds in database, which has informaiton for district + state (full hierarchy)

{

     "locations": \[{

      "type":"locationType"

      "value":"locationValue"

    }],

   "locationIds" : \[[["locationId1", "locationId2"|-locationId1-,--locationId2-]]]

}
