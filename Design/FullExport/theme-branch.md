* This branch will contain the Jekyll code
    * HTML layouts for pages and sidebars etc
    * plugins

    
* Purpose of maintaining it separately is that code is maintained at one place and consumed with all branches during the build. 
* Commit id will be inserted in the footer with the text "Build from commit <commit-id>" so that info is available from which commit it was build
