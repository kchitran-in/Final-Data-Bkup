* Only modified or added branch will be built and updated to the staging and prod instances.
* To include or remove any of the version -
    * widgets.json file will need to be updated (Not in release 1.9)
    * if removed - the robots.txt file will have to be updated

    
* Each build will pull theme so that each version gets same HTML/CSS (Not in release 1.9)
* CircleCI will listen to changes of all branches except gh-pages.
* No tag based deployment. 
* Commit id will be inserted in the footer with the text "Build from commit <commit-id>" so that info is available from which commit it was build

There will be 3 build pipelines for Docs - 
*  **Version**  - build and deploy version branches after any modification
*  **PR** - this will build and deploy preview site for pr
*  **TOC**  - whenever a toc branch is updated this build will be triggered

We are not considering build pipeline for main / marketing site in this release (1.9).
