 **Problem Statement:** 
* User can can bookmark the content. Content/collections inside of other collections (include courses, textbooks etc.) can also be bookmarked.
* User can see recently viewed content. Only leaf-node content that was actually PLAYED should be displayed in this row (not collections/books/courses etc.)
* The display should be shown based on which was used latest by the current user.

 **Solution :   ** Create a new table called  **content_markers**  to store the bookmarked and online played content. Schema of the table will be as follows:



| Column Name | Type | Value | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| identifier | text | content identifier | 
| data | text | Content json | 
| marker | integer |  | 
| visibility | text | Default / Parent | 
| epoch_timestamp | integer |  | 
| uid | text | User id | 
|  |  |  | 
|  |  |  | 

Values for marker00 - NONE (0)

01 - PREVIEWED (1)

10 - BOOKMARKED (2)



Will do the bitwise operation while storing and retrieving the value for  **marker** .

 **OR**  - While storing the data

 **AND**  - While retrieving the data



SQLite Bitwise Operators:Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Following is the truth table for  **&**  and  **|** .



| p | q | p&q | p|q | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 
|  |  |  |  | 

A = 0001

B = 0010

-----------------

A|B = 0011

A&B = 0000



 **When to add the row in this table?** 

- When user bookmarks any content

- When user played any content

 **When to delete the row from this table?** 

- When user remove bookmark then check in  **content_access**  table that in content is not played than remove else not.




### Query to get the bookmarked contents

```sql
Select * from content_markers where (marker&BOOKMARKED) == BOOKMARKED;
```



### Query to get the recently play contents

```sql

```
