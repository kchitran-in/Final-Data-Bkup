</li><li>Resource Type:  Play - Primary Category is  Learning Resource

</li><li>Resource Type:  Practice - Primary Category is  Learning Resource (the reason I want to tag it to Learning Resource instead of QuestionSet is, we do not know if this is actually a set of questions or something else) 

</li><li>Resource Type:  Read - Primary Category is  Learning Resource 

</li><li>Resource Type: Teach -    Primary Category is Teacher Resource

</li><li>Resource Type: Test - Primary Category is Learning Resource (the reason I want to tag it to Learning Resoruce instead of QuestionSet is, we do not know if this is actually a set of questions or something else)

</li><li>In case Resource Type is not available - Primary Category is  Learning Resource
