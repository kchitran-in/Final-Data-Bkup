 **INTRODUCTION:** 

The ML reports provide the program managers and admins detailed data on different solutions that are rolled out as a part of a state-run programs. As of now, there are 4 different types of solutions: Observation with a rubric, observation without a rubric, surveys, and projects. Each type of solution has its own data on the solutions consumed by the users.

*  **Project Report**  : Enables user to undertake a set of action projects purposefully with a specific objective in a specific period of time. Education leaders can create projects, invite others as collaborators, assign timelines, execute and monitor progress.    



                 1.  **Task Report**  : Details of the projects assigned to User

                 2.  **Status Report**  : Tracking status of project


*  **Observation Report** : Equips user to create their own framework and assess individuals of the education system including HMs , teachers and other officials.



                  1.  **Status Report**  :  Status of the observation form assigned to user

                  2.  **Question Report**  : Observation form detail assigned to user


*  **Observation with Rubric :** 



                  1.  **Status Report**  : Status of the observation form assigned to user with rubric form

                  2.  **Question Report**  : Observation form detail assigned to user with rubric form 

                  3.  **Domain criteria Report**  : Domain and criteria data with rubric form assigned to user

 **Proposed Design for Data Product**  :  A new data product for Ml Reports to be implemented with the defined data product framework. This Report is generated based on Demand.  An independent Data exhaust using  Scala  would be coded and extends BaseReportsJob.  A generic ML Data product would be written to handle all these 7 different data exhausts that are listed above.

 **Submit Api**  : It is an existing api which will be used in our Data Product
