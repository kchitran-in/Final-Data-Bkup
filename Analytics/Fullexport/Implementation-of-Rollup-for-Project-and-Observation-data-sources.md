 **INTRODUCTION:** 

The data related to projects and observations consumed by users are ingested into druid from a permanent data source( MongoDB ) using a batch processing cron job. Both these are non-transactional.

 **BACKGROUND:** 

Upon each transaction, the data is written to MongoDB and Kafka. But in MongoDB, only the data with the latest status is made available. The same is ingested in druid also.

The data ingestion to druid is done using a job, which deletes the indices, re-creates them, and then ingests the entire data until the time of execution. As data is growing exponentially on day-to-day transactions, re-writing the entire data is not a feasible approach.

To avoid complete data restoration every day, the following design is proposed.

 **DESIGN:** 


* On each transaction, ingest raw data into ingestion druid cluster and rollups into reporting cluster reading data from Kafka.


* Since raw data is ingested separately, this can be used for further analysis.


* Existing transactions are ingested from MongoDB as a one time execution.
