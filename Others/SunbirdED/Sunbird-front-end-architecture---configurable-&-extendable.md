## Introduction:
This document talks about ease of adoption & contribution of front-end application.


## Background:
Present Sunbird adoption of front-end(portal/app) application configuration is manual driven. It is very difficult for the adopter to configure specific features as per his requirement & passing the required configuration for the application. 

The intent of the document is for ease of adoption of front-end application. 


## Problem Statement:


Today problems:


* To contribute to any specific feature entire portal has to setup with all the configurations properly. 


* The features can’t deploy & verify independently. All the features has to be package & deployed as part of portal.


* Any change in code is executing all the unit test cases as part of CircleCI which is taking more time.


* Any specific component is having any compilation issues entire portal is blocked for testing.


* Software update should make sure all the component/modules also should be upgraded to the same version to build & deploy the portal.


* Huge list of configuration variables difficult to configure & maintain.


* Any dependent module/library is not supported, then entire portal is blocked.


* Large localisation files for 




## Key design problems:

1. Configurable:  Features/components should be configurable while building the portal(Adoption/Customisation).


1. Extendable: Ease of extension of specific feature or component


1. Templetization: Ease of configuring the different template/layout/theme for the components


1. Packaging: Ease of packaging of components to build portal(Adoption & Customisation)

## Angular Front-end microservices:
In the single Angular project we can create the sub-projects based on feature/pages. This projects separation should able to work independently without any dependency on other projects.



 **Sample application:** 

[https://github.com/vinukumar-vs/ng-module-federation/tree/main/Module%20federation/mdmf-sample1/mdmf-starter](https://github.com/vinukumar-vs/ng-module-federation/tree/main/Module%20federation/mdmf-sample1/mdmf-starter)

 **Pros:** 
* Each project can be run & deployed independently.


    * Ease of Adoption/Contribute: Adopter can setup the project specific to the requirement & test it independently.


    * The changes can to pushed to specific project & unit tests execution will be faster.



    
* Minimal list of environment variables specific to individual project.


    * ease of Adoption:  can set-up specific project environment variables



    

 **Cons:** 
* All the projects dependencies has to be updated in the single root application package.json file only.


* Even though projects are separated, we have close the entire github repo to work on specific project.


* Versioning of projects should be handled manually, as individual projects can be deployed independently.


* Each project should be launched as individual hosts, hence the header & footer of the home project should be maintained across all the projects. (additional overhead)


* Sharing of data between projects only allowed through local-cache or passing through URL’s.(recommented)




## Frontend microservices as framework agnostic:
All front-end modules are published as pure NPM modules as framework agnostic(Pure HTML/JS/Typescript libraries). So any dependent application will load these libraries as NPM modules irrespective of tech stack being used by the parent application



Using Module Federation:[https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/)





 **Pros:** 
* One line statement of advantage with this solution.



 **Cons:** 
* One line statement of disadvantage with this solution.
