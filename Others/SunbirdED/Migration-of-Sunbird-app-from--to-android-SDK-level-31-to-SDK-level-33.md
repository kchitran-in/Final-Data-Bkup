Migration to SDK 33 requires migration for cordova-android which is detailed in the [Cordova  documentation](https://cordova.apache.org/announcements/2023/05/22/cordova-android-12.0.0.html)

In Sunbird-mobile-app, the following files need to be changed

 **Step-1** 

[ **build.sh** ](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/build.sh)

In this file, the Cordova version needs to be changed along with the Gradle version.

The Gradle version should be changed to 7.5.1 and the Cordova version should be changed to 12.0.0

[buildConfig/build.gradle](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/buildConfig/build.gradle)

In build.gradle update build-tool version to 33.0.2 and defaultTargetSdkVersion, defaultCompileSdkVersion to 33

Update the targetSdk version in config.xml

As we are supporting API level 33, we have to support Androidâ€™s new SplashScreen API. For that, we have to make the following changes


* Remove all splash-related tags from config,xml.


* Add [colors.xml](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/resources/android/colors.xml) and [themes.xml](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/resources/android/themes.xml) in r[esources/android](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/tree/release-5.1.0.10/resources/android) folder.


* The above-mentioned 2 files should be copied to platforms/android/app/src/main/res/values folder and to  achieve that we have to execute the script [fix-android-sdk33-migration.js](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/scripts/android/fix-android-sdk33-migration.js) during build time so this script should be added in the Cordova build hooks.

* Convert drawable-ldpi-icon.png to [drawable-ldpi-icon.xml](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app/blob/release-5.1.0.10/resources/android/icon/drawable-ldpi-icon.xml) as the new SplashScreen API supports svg.
