| S1 Process - Support ver 1.0 | 
| S1 process for support is defined to follow the structured approach in case any Severity 1 issue is reported via the Freshdesk Tool. It documents the action between various functions in order to address and close the issue reported by the user. | 
| Scope of this process is limited to the tickets raised via the freshdesk tool for severity 1 classified by the L2 Support Team.This S1 process is for DIKSHA only. Not for issues faced by any other adopter(s). | 
| L1 Support Team , L2 Support Team, S1- Coordinator (from Support), Engineering Coordinator, Implementation Team, Engineering Team, Business Representative (ETB, EQB, TPD) | 
| Freshdesk Ticket initiated on the Freshdesk Tool triggers the process and the closure of the Freshdesk Ticket ends the process. |

# Exceptions 
The Exceptions to this process is outlined below:


1. Triage calls will happen during the working hour over the weekdays and the next morning if the issue is identified post working hours.
1. Triage calls over the weekend will be subject to availability of the participants else the call will be conducted on the next working day for all.
1. This process does not capture the closure of the Jira Ticket (It is subject to RCA done on the issue)
1. The S1 coordinator, L2 Support Lead and Engineering Coordinator have no votes during the Triage Call. They will just provide the qualifying information and gather inputs.
1. There will be a max of 5 folks on the triage group(excluding the coordinators). It is only their vote that will count in deciding whether the S1 ticket is indeed an S1. The representation will be from:
    * Minimum of 3 participants required to attain a quorum.

    


# Process Metrics
The process metrics are as follows:


1. % accuracy on the rubric followed by L2 Support (% of instances NOT moved down from a S1 to S2 bucket post triage)- Should be greater than 80% (L2 Metric)
1. % variance on ETA provided during the Triage process. Variance should not be greater than 10% (L3 Metric)
