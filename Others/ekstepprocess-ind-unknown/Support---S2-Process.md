# Process General Details
falseS1 Process - SupportThe S2 process outlines the basis of Severity Classification done at the Support Level on Freshdesk and Jira Interfaces and the efforts to drive closure of the ticket.





| S2 Process - Support ver 1.0 | 
| S2 process for support is defined to follow the structured approach in case any Severity 2 issue is reported via the Freshdesk Tool. It documents the action between various functions in order to address and close the issue reported by the user within 3 releases from the date the bug is prioritized as P2. | 
| Scope of this process is limited to the tickets raised via the freshdesk tool for severity 2 classified by the L2 Support Team.This S2 process is for DIKSHA only. Not for issues faced by any other adopter(s). | 
| L1 Support Team , L2 Support Team, Solution Circle Owners, Implementation Team, Engineering Team | 
| Freshdesk Ticket initiated on the Freshdesk Tool triggers the process and the closure of the Freshdesk Ticket ends the process. | 
| 1. Issue Raised 2. Severity Classification by L2 Support 3. Priority Justification 4. ETA confirmation (ETA on S2 to be communicated as "within the next three months") 5. Solution  6. Closure of Issue |

1. This process does not capture the closure of the Jira Ticket
1. Changes to the Circle composition basis time
1. Change/deprecation of feature within the 3 cycles of deployment.


# Process Metrics
The process metrics are as follows:


1. % accuracy of the debugging efforts by L2 should be over 90%
