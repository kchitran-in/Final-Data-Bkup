# Process General Details




| Release Documentation Process | 
| The release documentation process involves creating, maintaining and publishing documentation for external user consumption, for every version of the solution released to the client. Documentation delivery is part of the solution delivery. It follows the same delivery cadence. Documentation deliverables are defined by the scope of the release. Documentation for release delivery typically entails creating and publishing the following artefacts:<ul><li>Release Notes

</li><li>End-user documents (How-To Documents published on the websites, pdfs, videos)

</li><li>Developer Documents

</li></ul> | 
| As part of the Release Documentation process, the team lead identifies the Jira tickets with stories and enhancements being delivered for a particular release. In other words, the team lead identifies the release delivery scope. After the release scope is frozen, the team lead analyzes the relevant stories or tasks and defines the documentation scope for the release. After a careful analysis, tasks are created, effort analysed and work is assigned to the respective team members. Each assignee takes up the task and delivers as per the schedule. After sign-off, the relevant documents are published to the relevant website.The process does not take into account interrupts or scope creeps after the release scope is frozen.  | 
| Product Manager, Tech Manager, Implementation Team, Documentation Team | 
| The release documentation cycle begins with each release cycle and ends when the release is pushed to production (live) | 
| Release Documentation has 5 stages: 1) Requirement analysis2) Planning and estimation3) Document creation4) Review & Rework5) Publish |
