## Overview:
Need to design a module which is capable of queuing requests from the system.Request can be of following types:

a) Import Request

b) Delete Request

c) Export Request

d) Network Sync Request

       1) Telemetry Sync Request

       2)  Course Sync Request

       3)  FAQ Sync Request

       4)  Assessments Sync Request




## Problem statement: 
Offline Consumption Clients like Mobile,Desktop should have the capability to queue the requests as per user interaction. Since most of the times these clients are believed to be offline & support System Resource operations, It creates a need to have a queuing mechanism for the system so that user don't end up for longer time waiting for these requests to be served. Absence of such a system would end up having prolonged user experience, inefficient usage of system resources etc.


## Solution:

* Create two Queues in the system which can be broadly classified as follows:
    * System Queue
    * System Queue intends to support following operations:
    * Import (Download)
    * Delete
    * Export

    

    
    * Network Queue 

    
    * Network Queue
    * Telemetry Sync
    * Course Sync
    * FAQ Sync
    * Assessments Sync

    

    

    
* System Queue : This queue will enque the requests related to file system operations. There has been different categorisation to ensure we don't end up utilising resources during user interaction.
    * Export
    * Import
    * Delete

    


## Implementation Design:
Network Queue: 

Document Object:

{

id:,

baseUrl:,

pathToApi:,

requestHeaderObj:,

requestBody:,

authHeaderToken:,

BearerToken:,

priority:,

createdOn:,

updatedOn:,

}

SQLLite Table:



| id | baseUrl | pathToApi | requestHeaderObj | requestBody | authHeaderToken | BearerToken | priority | createdOn | updatedOn | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

System Queue:





Document Object:

{

id: ,

type: '', //Example 'EXPORT','DELETE','IMPORT'/'DOWNLOAD',

size: '',

artifactUrl: '',

fileName: '',

Status:'',

Progress:'', //Percentage of Completion

createdOn: '',

updatedOn: '',

priority: ''

}

SQLLite Table







| id | type | size | artifactUrl | fileName | Status | Progress | createdOn | updatedOn | priority | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
