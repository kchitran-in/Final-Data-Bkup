Problem Statement:
As a user, I want to know if I have been validated by my state administrator. In the present form, this information can be derived from the attribute - rootOrgId. If the user's rootOrgId is not a custodian org id, then it is derived that the user is a state validated user.

Ref: [SB-14445 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-14445)


## Solution 
Since this attribute of state validated is a core user and admin related piece, we would like to make this flag in the backend services only. So, our vote is for Approach 1 in this document. Other approaches are written for discussion purposes.


### Approach 1:
 Learner service will add a new identifier "stateValidated" in user request. Below changes required for this approach.


* Filed "stateValidated" is not going to be added as a column in the user table, the value for this filed is converted to binary-value format which is converted to decimal and saved in fiagsValue column in user table.
* During user create , based on associated rootOrg this value will be set as true/false
* Add this field in ES as searchable ,so that admin can get reports
* Write a migration job for old user data , stateValidated field value(boolean flag to decimal value) is updated in fiagsValue column in user table
* Write a job that will take userId and do user Sync (We already have Talend job to do that)



| Pros | Cons​ | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| As business logic to mark user validate in one place , it's easy to manage/update | Required migration job for old user | 
| Report can be easily generated using user search api call. |  | 




### Approach 2:
 Consumer can add business logic for showing user as state validated or not. As of now this can be done based on user rootOrgId/channel



| Pros​ | Cons | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| There is no code change in learner-service | Business logic is expose to client , later it would be difficult to update business logic, specifically for mobile device.  | 
|  | It's not best practise to expose business intelligence on client. | 
|  | Report can not be generated  | 



API changesget-user APIOne additional boolean field "stateValidated" is added to response. True indicates that the user is indeed a state validated user, false otherwise.


### Approach 3
This approach suggests instead of storing individual boolean fields in table, we can store them in a single column - sum and store the flags values as a base10. This change is only in the primary database; shows 

Notes:


* Each and every individual boolean field is considered as bit and it's value true or false is considered as bit value 1 or 0
* Enums are going to be defined such that flags become enum names and their values are left shifted by 1. 
* Let's say, there are 3 boolean fields emailVerified, phoneVerified, tncAccepted. emailVerified will be given a value 1, phoneVerified will be given a value 2, tncAccepted will be given a value 4.
* The decimal value is saved into the table(user), creating a new column "flagAttribs" in user table and save into it.
* Existing boolean flags will be removed, only isDeleted flag remains as usual considering its criticality.
* Instead of that boolean flags their respective bit location values are calculated and updated into the "flagAttribs" filed.



| Name | Value | 
|  --- |  --- | 
| emailVerified | 1 | 
| phoneVerified | 2 | 
| tncAccepted | 4 | 
| emailVerified and phoneVerified | 3 | 
| emailVerified and tncAccepted | 5 | 
| phoneVerified and tncAccepted | 6 | 

API changes:get-user API :One additional boolean field "stateValidated" is added to response. True indicates that the user is indeed a state validated user, false otherwise. The other boolean flags continue to be served.

Create-user API/ Update-user API :
* From now boolean flags will not be saved as boolean column in user table, all their cumulative value is saved in "flagsValue" column
* In ES individual boolean fields will be saved and searching can be done these fields.

Bulk-user creation/update API :
* From now boolean flags will not be saved as boolean column in user table, all their cumulative value is saved in "flagsValue" column
* In ES individual boolean fields will be saved and searching can be done these fields.


### Conclusion   
Approach 3 is favoured to be picked up for the following reasons:


1. There are already 3-4 existing flags that can be unified into a single column.
1. Cassandra can work with multi-columns easily, but we have plans to migrate this data into a SQL store. So, a write can be efficient.
1. The Analytics team might want to deposit some flags as well against the user. So these can scale well to a good set of flags we want in future.


### Updates
tncAccepted = 4 was not done; instead stateValidated = 4 was assigned.
