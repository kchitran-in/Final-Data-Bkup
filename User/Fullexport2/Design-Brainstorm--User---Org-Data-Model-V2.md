 **Org & Org Membership** 


* Org is a tenant in Sunbird - used to tag content, courses & telemetry.


* Org membership will be used for assigning system roles for users. These system roles are used to determine what a user can/cannot do in the system.


* Self signed up users will not be part of any org and will not have any role by default.


* A user can have membership and different roles in multiple orgs.


* Access Scope of a role: E.g.: CONTENT_CREATOR with scope as "subject=Maths" and PROFILE_VALIDATOR with scope as "position=Teacher & school_code=S123". Scope attributes vary for each role. This will enable orgs to manage roles at a more granular level without the need for creating sub-orgs.


* Scope management at a user & role level can be simplified by rule based auto role assignment. e.g: all users with validated profile as "principal" in a school will get PROFILE_VALIDATOR role for "teacher" positions in the same school.



 **User Profile - Positions** 


* User can self declare information of what he/she does outside the system, i.e. positions held by the user in one or more orgs. The list of positions are limited to a master list of positions defined in the system.


* Each position info comprises of the org, location details and position specific details (like school udise code, teacher id for a teacher position).


* User positions will get validated by users of the org who have the appropriate system role & scope to do the validation.


* This information is mainly used for reporting purposes. In future, they can be used for attestation/validation of user profile (by other systems).


* Key Decision Point - separation of user declared positions and system roles as different entities.



 **Sub-Orgs or Multiple orgs in each tenant** 


* Use cases of sub-orgs:


    * A state has different subject departments (maths, science, etc) and wants to have separate set content creators & reviewers for each department.


    * A school principal wants to run a course batch only for teachers of his/her school.



    
* First use case can be handled by specifying access scope for the roles (CONTENT_CREATOR & CONTENT_REVIEWER).


* Second use case can be addressed by creating a group of users and creating a invite-only batch for that group.


* User association to a school will only be via User Profile - Positions and not via org membership. Any activities that need to be done for a specific school will be enabled via groups & group activities.



 **Telemetry & Reports** 


* Consumption attribution?


* Reports by multiple dimensions - org, location, positions (school, etc)…
