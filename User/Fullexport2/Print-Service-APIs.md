c) context  is the map which will have placeholders and their value (ex: $recipientName : John Deo)  

d) ttl in response is Time To Live after certain period of the time download link will be expire, refer [this](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/1100414991/Credentials+for+everyone#Credentialsforeveryone-/download-GetsasignedURLtothecertificate) to re-download.
