As part of user-org refactoring to suit manage learn use cases, from 3.8 release :  


* Schools as stored as organisations instead of suborgs. 


* Changes are made to the schema to identify whether an organisation is a tenant or organisation type is a board/school/contentorg. 


* Locations are currently stored as List<String> and this is going to change to reflect the type of location id, whether the given location id is of a state or district or block.


* Classification of orgs - board/school/contentorg, based on org_type and isTenant flag.

    eg. cbse is a board + tenant=true, rj is board + tenant=true, khan - content org, tenant = false


* Association to custodian should be descoped in future (Eventual future)




## Problem statement 

* Schools are stored as sub-organisations and this restricts the school to be under a particular board.


* There are parent/root orgs and sub orgs, but no way to identify the type of org or is the org is a tenant.


* Org locations are stored as a location id list in user table, and this requires a lookup to location table to understand the type of location for each location id. 




## Solution
In release 3.8, to make the data storage more generic and usable below changes are proposed:

Add istenant column to organisation table, and store the isrootorg column value in istenant column, in subsequent release remove the isrootorg column.


```
istenant boolean
```
Update the org locations in a  **json structure**  to a new  **text**  field, orglocation, instead of storing it in locationIds. In subsequent release, remove the locationIds column.


```
orglocation text
```
Remove the orgtype column  and add organisationType column , which will save int values corresponding to the organisation types like board/school/contentorg. The types will be represented with bit posotions: 

bit 0 isBoard

bit 1 isSchool

bit 2 canCreateContent

bit 3 isBoard

So value in digit for board - 5, school - 2


```
organisationType int
```
Update the rootorgid column with values from id column.


## Example  
Sample data for orgLocation in table and ES doc


```
"orgLocation" : 
[
  {
    "type": "state"
    "id": "<locationid>"
  },
  {
    "type": "district"
    "id": "<locationid>"
  },
  {
    "type": "block"
    "id": "<locationid>"
  },
  {
    "type": "cluster"
    "id": "<locationid>"
  }
]] ]></ac:plain-text-body></ac:structured-macro><p>Store the above <code>orgLocation</code> structure either as a json string.</p><p>Table structure with new approach:</p><ac:structured-macro ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1" ac:macro-id="8f8f346a-bab5-4523-ab15-94fd735d3745"><ac:plain-text-body><![CDATA[CREATE TABLE sunbird.organisation (

 **Data Migration:** 


* To update istenant flag for organisation which has organisationtype as ‘5’


* To update organisationtype as board/school/contentorg with respective int values


* To update rootorgid column with ‘id’ column data


* To restructure location ids in organisation table and update to orglocation column



 **Impacted Areas:** 

 **APIs** 


1. /v1/org/create - organisationtype, orglocation, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid update logic to be need to be changed.


1. /v1/org/update  - organisationtype, orglocation, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid update logic to be need to be changed.


1. /v1/org/read - organisationtype, orglocation, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid  read logic to be need to be changed.


1. /v1/org/search - organisationtype, orglocation, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid  read logic to be need to be changed.


1. /data/sync api changes to index the orglocation in ES


1. /v3/user/read - api changes to return rootorg.rootorgid as organisation id for backward compatibility.


1. /v1/org/upload - organisationtype, orglocation, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid update logic to be need to be changed.


1. Add member/remove member APIs to be removed.


1. Last login update API should return 200 always


1. Re-indexing the org index for better performance and new changes


1. Removing below set of APIs





| /v1/org/type/create | 
| /v1/org/type/update | 
| /v1/org/type/list | 

 **Analytics Reports**  - logic to pull organisationtype, organisation.locationids, istenant, isrootorg, rootorgid in reports need to be updated.


1. Self Declaration Report


1. Progress Exhaust


1. User Info Exhaust


1. User Cache Updater
