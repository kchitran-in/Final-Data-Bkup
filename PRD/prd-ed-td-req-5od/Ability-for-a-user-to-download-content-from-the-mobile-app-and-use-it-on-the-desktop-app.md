 **JTBD** As a teacher,

I want to be able to import SunbirdEd content that I have downloaded from the mobile app, or that someone has shared with me onto the desktop app

So that I can use it in class to teach. 

 **Context** Many of the teachers in Government schools do not have access to computers at home. In order to use the content in the offline computers available in classes, they need to be bring it to the school on an external device like a pendrive. In order to support this, they should be able to download content from the mobile app, export it to a pendrive and then import it using the desktop app. This is the mechanism used by many teachers on the field in order to move videos (non-SunbirdEd videos) to a desktop. 

The current exported .ecar file formats are incompatible between the mobile app and the desktop app.

This epic covers two primary capabilities:


* Compatibility of the .ecar file formats between mobile app and desktop app when exported
* A mechanism for a user to share the content from the mobile app to the desktop
