IntroductionField tests have shown that teachers struggle to:


* Find their textbooks when setup by someone else on the desktop app for use in class
* Find textbooks or content that they would like to download 
* Realise that they are online and can download content

Owing to this, there is a need to improve content discoverability on the desktop app. 

JTBD
*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** 
    * As a teacher/student, I want to find my textbook quickly, So that I can view digital content that is linked to it. 
    * As a teacher at home, I want to find textbooks to download, So that I can take it with me to school on a pendrive. 

    
*  **User Personas:**  Government school teacher, student
*  **System or Environment:**  At home with intermittent connectivity, At school with intermittent or no connectivity

Requirement SpecificationsThis section consists of requirement specifications for specific use cases in the User JTBD. The requirements for each use case are elaborated in detail through sub-sections for:


* Use case overview
* Overall process workflow
* Associated user stories 
* Non-functional requirements
* Localization requirements  
* Telemetry requirements
* Dependencies
* Impact on other products
* Impact on existing data  

<Improve the experience of the My Library and Browse Online so that teachers can find textbooks faster> OverviewTodays My Library page has a Recently Added section, and class-based categories. Teachers and students don't find this categorisation very intuitive, and hence end up trying to use filters, or scrolling through the recently added section in order to find the book that they are looking for. Teachers are also unable to rationalise the difference between their library and the browse online section. 

This story involves renaming My Library to My Downloads, adding subject based categories, an all downloads section and improving the filters to allow users to navigate between medium and class. 

<Main Scenario>

<Improve the textbook details page so that a user can play the exact content they're looking for> OverviewBased on field studies, it is apparent that users struggle with the actions to perform on the textbook details page. This needs to be improved in order to 


* Ensure the user is shown the textbook TOC, and can easily navigate between chapters to get to the content they're looking for.
* Ensure the user can play content from the TOC - and that they can additionally download the content or copy it to an external source, should they choose to do so.
* Ensure the user can also download the entire textbook or copy the entire textbook to an external source, should they choose to do so. 

<Main Scenario>

<Alternate Scenario 1>



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result |

| 2 | The user is on a low bandwidth connection or a poor RAM machine and is trying to open the textbook | The textbook page slowly loads using lazy loading |

<Improve the search experience on the desktop app> OverviewThe current search experience is localised to a particular page in the app - i.e a user can either search inside of their downloads or inside of the online library. This leads users to be confused, as they expect to be able to search throughout the app - owing to the mobile paradigm of how search works. Hence, search needs to be promoted to a global concept - with users being able to search with a keyword, and then have results across My Downloads and the online library show up. 

<Main Scenario>

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | The user searches for content when they are online | They are shown results from both the online library and downloads if they match the keywords | 
| 2 | The user searches for content when offline | They are only shown results from their downloads if they match the keywords | 

<Alternate Scenario 1>



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | The user searches for content when they are online - but there are results available only from the online library | They are told that there are no downloaded results, but are shown the list of available content from the internet | 
| 2 | The user searches for content when they are online - but no content (either from their online library or downloads) matches their search results | They are told to try another keyword | 
| 3 | The user is offline and is searching for content, but there are no results from their downloads | They are told that they need to come online to find matching results |
