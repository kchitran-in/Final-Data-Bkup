As a teacher

I want a quick access to recently imported/downloaded content in the offline app

So that I am assured that the content I have imported/downloaded is in my offline library, and I can access it immediately if needed in class. 



 **Acceptance Criteria** 

GIVEN I am a teacher and I am either downloading content from the internet or uploading it from an external source

WHEN the content has finished downloading

THEN I am able to see that content listed in the "Recently Added Content" section (ordered by recency of content download) 



 **Note** 

This section will show all types of content - Books, Collections and individual resources, ordered by most recently downloaded.
