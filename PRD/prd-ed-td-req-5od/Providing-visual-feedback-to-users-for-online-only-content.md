 **As**  a teacher

 **I want to**  know that I'm downloading or attempting to play online-only content

 **So that**  I'm aware that it can't be used in offline environments. 

 **Context** 

The SunbirdEd offline app can be used in both online and offline modes. Many content providers tend to create online-only content (like youtube), which can only be used in the online mode. Users need to be appropriately warned that they are downloading online-only content, and also that they are attempting to play online-only content if they are offline or have low bandwidth. 



 **Acceptance Criteria** 

GIVEN I am on the desktop app 

WHEN I attempt to download an individual content or a textbook which has online-only content 

THEN I am shown a message that the content I'm trying to download has content that can only be played online. 



GIVEN I am on the offline library section of the desktop app

WHEN I view content cards that contain online-only content

THEN I am shown some sort of visual indicator that the content card has online-only content. 



GIVEN I am on the offline library section of the desktop app and I am offline 

WHEN I attempt to play content that requires an internet connection

THEN I am shown a message that the content cannot be played offline, and that I need to be connected to the internet.
