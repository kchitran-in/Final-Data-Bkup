### Milestones & Timelines:

1. Verify the offline playback works with an ECAR that is manually constructed - 21 April

    This is actually done for the structure [[defined here|ECAR-Structure-for-Interactive-Videos]], however on Friday when testing along with the mobile team, we noticed that the Question Set ECAR structure, and the structure used by the app is different. So we need to connect with the mobile team to validate


1. Test if the same ECAR works offline on Mobile (can test by sideloading) - 26 April

    Here, we will need help from the mobile team to create a build for the mobile app, with the latest player code integrated. 


1. Generate a ECAR using the new publish pipeline, ensure the structure matches the manual ECAR - 26 April


1. Test if the player works with this ECAR - 27 April


1. Test if the mobile offline playback works with this ECAR (can test by sideloading) - 27 April
