## Key Metrics
The main metric to track here will be engagement with the interactive video. Some of the metrics we can use for this purpose are listed below



|  **Srl. No.**  |  **Metric**  |  **Purpose**  |  **Formula**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1. | No. of interactive videos created | To understand usage and adoption of interactive videos on the creator side | Count of unique interactive video identifier | 
| 2 | No. of unique viewers | To understand reach of interactive videos in terms of viewers | Count of unique viewers across all interactive videos | 
| 3 | Average Completion Rate | To understand engagement of the interactions embedded in the videos | No. of Questions Answered in IVs /Total No. of Questions in IVs | 
| 4 | Average Video Duration | To get a sense of length of average interactive video and compare with average watch time | Average (Duration of all Interactive Videos) | 
| 5 | Average Watch Time | To get a sense of engagement on interactive videos | Average (Watch Time of all Interactive Videos) | 
| 6  | Average Rating  | To get a sense of overall user experience | Average (Rating across all Interactive Videos) | 


* The goal will be to understand the performance of interactive videos especially when compared to passive videos. So it is important that we also have comparable metrics for passive videos. 


* We must also provide filters for selecting all or specific interactive videos.
