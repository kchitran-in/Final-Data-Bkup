# Accuracy Score

### Introduction & Overview

* Currently the scorecard at the end of an interactive video displays aggregate score basis correct questions answered


* This is because questions are currently lazy loaded and hence if a question is skipped by moving the cursor, its score is not considered which makes calculating accuracy difficult



In 4.2, we propose to enhance the player to display the accuracy score (%) i.e. Marks for Questions answered correctly / Aggregate Marks across all questions


### Proposed Workflow

* We propose to fetch information about total marks during the question creation phase


* This information can be fetched from the meta data of the questions added
