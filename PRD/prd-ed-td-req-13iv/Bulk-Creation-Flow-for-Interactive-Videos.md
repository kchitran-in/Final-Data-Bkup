# Introduction & Overview
With consumption of interactive videos being enabled in 4.1, there is a strong case for building a tool that allows external stakeholders to bulk create interactive videos using their own library. This will help accelerate consumption and adoption of interactive videos on the Sunbird Platform. 

Jira Link: [https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-25748](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/SB-25748)


# Proposal
Following capabilities exist within the Sunbird platform independently:


* Video Import Tool - which allows bulk upload of passive video content


* Content Bulk Upload Tool - which allows bulk upload of questions in a CSV format



We propose to create a new tool that allows intercepting the video content uploaded at specific timestamps with question content uploaded


# Requirement Specifications
The use case we are targeting is as follows:

As a user or organization, I would like to bulk create interactive videos on Diksha so that it is available to a wide audience.


1. I should be able to import videos - using the video bulk upload tool/by feeding a list of youtube URLs


1. I should be able to import a file/multiple files containing my question bank using the question bulk import tool


1. I should be able to intercept the questions from the question bank at specific timestamps on the videos by uploading this information in the required format


1. I should be able to receive updates on progress and of success/failure of individual interactive video creation.
