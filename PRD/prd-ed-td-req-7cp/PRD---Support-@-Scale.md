IntroductionAs a consumer of the Sunbird clients, I would like to get some help on issues I face with the (web or mobile) app. This PRD covers the various use-cases around the same.

*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** As a user, I might face issues with using the consumption clients (web or mobile app). The current way of resolving my questions would be to send a support request via email to the Sunbird instance owner. However, there may be multiple reasons why this isn't a satisfactory solution:
    * I might not know how to send an email (or what details should go into it).
    * I need an answer NOW, and the response from support will take some delay.
    * I might not know what to expect in the app, and I don't want to look dull by asking a question that may be obvious.
    * I might not be comfortable with phrasing my question in English, and thereby get an answer not relevant to my actual problem.

    
* 80% of the current negative ratings are due to the 'Content Coming Soon' message - users find this quite annoying.
*  **User Personas:**  [Teacher](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Teacher), [Student](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Student), [Ram](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Ram), [Shyam](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Shyam)
*  **System or Environment:**  Mostly at home, though likely to be used even at school or while in transit.



Use-case 1: Show an FAQ and an option to send in a support requestIt would be good to show the user an FAQ so they can get a response sooner than usual to a problem they might be facing.

In the case that the concern is not covered as part of the FAQ, provide a way to send in a custom support request.

Process WorkflowSupport receives direct support requests via the helpdesk, or indirect concerns via the Play Store ratings/review section. The more prominent issues are put together in the order of most critical/frequently asked with an answer for the same. They work with Documentation for the phrasing of the question and answers, and for the localization into the supported languages.

The end users, when facing an issue, will click on the burger menu of the main tabs and select 'Support' from there. They will then proceed to go through the FAQ. If they don't see any that matches their query, they'll tap on 'Other support request' and proceed to send an email to the support team.

As documentation team, I should be able to add a Q&A to the current FAQ, so the FAQ is always updated[SB-11832 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-11832)The documentation team gets a new/updated Q&A from the support team and has to add it to the current edition. They also need to localize it wherever needed.

Main Scenario - Adding Q&A(s)

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Ram receives Q&A(s) from support team to add to existing list. | Ram acknowledges the request. | 
|  | For each Q&A, Ram chooses the position in the FAQ, adds it there and saves it. | The FAQ gets updated with the new question(s) at the intended position(s).  | 

Alternate Scenario 1 - Removing Q&A(s)

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Ram receives input from support team to remove question(s) that's no longer valid. | Ram acknowledges the request. | 
|  | Ram chooses the Q&A(s) to remove and saves it. | The FAQ gets updated with the selected question(s) removed. | 

Alternate Scenario 2 - Modifying Q&A(s)

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Ram receives input from support team to modify Q&A(s). | Ram acknowledges the request. | 
|  | One by one, Ram chooses the Q&A(s) to update, makes the change and saves it. | The FAQ gets updated with the selected question(s) updated. | 

Exception Scenarios

| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Shyam is in the midst of adding/editing/removing/saving Q&A(s), and one of the following happens:<ul><li>Closes the window by mistake.</li><li>Internet connection is lost.</li><li>System goes unresponsive/hangs.</li><li>System returns a failure to save.</li></ul> | Old Q&A should persist. |

WireframesN/A - expecting this to be handled via simple(existing?) internal tooling.

For Future ReleaseSeparate sites for web app /mobile app (as there may be app-specific FAQ listed there). Solution should be future proof, so that when newer mobile app versions are released, existing mobile apps continue to see the latest FAQ.

As a consumer, I should be able to see the existing FAQ[SB-11833 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-11833)The consumer has a concern, and visits the support section to resolve it. 

When the user is raising custom support requests, 50% of the time as per current data, the requests are blank. This may be because the user doesn't know how to send a support ticket, and is probably new to concept of sending a support request (or even how to send an email for that matter).

Main Scenario - User visits the FAQ and finds relevant Q&A(s)

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Ram visits the Help & Support section:<ul><li>Mobile: Taps on burger menu and clicks 'Help'</li><li>Web: Taps on 'Help Centre' button </li></ul> | Ram is taken to the Help & Support section that is consumption specific. | 
|  | Ram sees an appropriate question and taps on it. | The question expands to display the answer. | 

Alternate Scenario 1 - User doesn't find relevant Q&A(s)

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Ram taps on 'Other issue'. | Ram sees a popup informing user about details of the support needed.They are also informed that a mail will be initiated which the user has to send. | 
|  | Ram enters the details in the box and taps 'Write email'. | An email gets initiated via the default mail app with the title '<Sunbird instance> support request - <Device id>'.The device-specific details for the app are attached in the mail.The text entered by user is sent to the Sunbird instance via telemetry/API.To address is auto-populated as per configuration.The mail has the following format:"From: <User-type>, <Current Board>, <Current selected Medium>, <Current selected Class> **Ticket summary** <auto-populated with text from the user-input> **More details (If needed, provide more information or attach a screenshot of the issue)** " |

Use-case 2: Content Coming soon

Use Case 2 - Contextual 'Coming Soon' messageSince a tenant is unlikely to have comprehensive digital content, there is going to be a need for a placeholder message for empty textbook units. The current 'Content is coming soon' message is too generic. A hypothesis we have is that since there's no 'due-date' mentioned, users keep returning to see if content has arrived. Constant display of such a message frustrates the user, and they direct their anger and disappointment towards the app. The goal here is to:


* Provide a due-date, so that an expectation is set with the user about when to receive content for a particular node.
* For the user who still has frustrations about why there's so many empty nodes, a short explanation in the FAQ about why it was important to print QR codes in books in the first place (due to long update/publish cycles in the physical world), even if it meant having many nodes empty for the better part of a year.

Process WorkflowImplementation approaches tenants for custom 'Coming Soon' messages to be displayed to users for empty nodes, a catch-all message for a book, or a catch-all message at the level of the tenant. This is then added into the system. Based on the detail up to which the tenant goes, the message is packaged with the book (to enable offline support as well), or with tenant specific information packaged with the app. The book or the tenant specific information can be updated from time to time, which results in the app eventually getting the updated information without having to upgrade the app.

When the node is filled with atleast one content, the message is anyway not displayed.

As implementor, I should be able to add a 'Coming Soon' message at a tenant-specific level, so that any empty node/textbook unit can show a message specific to the tenant under whom the book was createdThe implementation team will reach out to tenants to obtain catch-all tenant-specific 'Coming Soon' messages. This is then updated by the tenant onto the Sunbird instance.

Main Scenario - Implementation team receives a tenant-specific 'Coming Soon' messageReplace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the main scenario of the user story. Describe the typical usage scenario, as envisaged from a user perspective in a sequence of steps in the following table.

As a creator, I should be able to add a 'Coming Soon' message at a node-specific level, so that the node (and their empty child nodes that don't have a 'Coming Soon' message) can show that messageIt's a matter of time before tenants realize that a tenant-level message isn't fair to its users, and will result in many modifications of the same over the course of months. At that moment, they will wish to provide tenant-specific messages at the level of a book, or better yet at the level of textbook nodes (based on the certainty they wish to go to).
