Library Display for signed-in users to tenants without boardJTBD + Overview **Job To Be Done: ** As a signed-in user from a tenant without a board, I should be able to see content in the library (preferably from my tenant) and not a blank page.

Overall Process Workflow
1. Ram signed in to a tenant without a board (e.g. NCERT).
1. Ram launches the mobile app
1. Ram should see relevant content for the particular medium and class combination that's currently highlighted. Content from his tenant should be shown first for the section that are displayed.


## Overview
Same as above.

Main Scenario

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User signs into tenant from mobile app | User lands on library page, and if B/M/C details aren't provided yet, then user is requested for these.In this scenario, user lands on a popup where the framework only has medium and class (no board). | 
|  | User sees a popup with just medium and class requested on it. | User selects medium and class and taps submit. | 
|  | User lands on the library page. | User sees the list of subjects across all boards from the currently selected medium and class combination with books for those subjects. Since the soft and hard filters can't be mixed, for now we'll include channel as a hard filter. As a result of this, only books from this tenant/channel will show up in the library for mobile. The books from his tenant should show first, if available in each subject section. | 



Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | There might be subjects that do not have content from the user's tenant for that medium/class combination. | For that subject, other books that match the medium/class/subject combo will be displayed (in whatever order selected by platform). |

<Use Case 2> JTBD + Overview **Job To Be Done: ** In this context, explain the current process for which this is an alternative or pain-point that this seeks to eliminate. Also, elaborate the substantial gain or business value that the solution brings in. 

Replace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the use case and provide a high-level overview of the use case for the JTBD or Initiative  

<Overall Process Workflow>Replace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the use case. Insert a diagram in the space below to depict the typical workflow for the envisaged use case. To do so, create the diagram in any editor and save as an image. Insert the image below.  

<User Story 1> OverviewReplace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the use case and the name of the first user story. Provide a high-level overview of the user story here. Each user story is further elaborated in its sub-sections. The principles to bear in mind while writing a user story are: 1) it comprehensively captures a unique feature or functionality that a user can accomplish using the system 2) it encapsulates a single unit of functionality 3) it corresponds to one JIRA story 4) it is accomplished in one release. If, in a rare case, the functionality of a user story needs to be developed iteratively, the story should contain the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) content within the 'Main Scenario' section. All functionality to be developed in future releases, should be part of the 'For Future Release' section. Whenever the functionality is taken up for a release, it should become part of the 'Main Scenario' section. The 'Main Scenario' section should always be in sync with the current system functionality if the story is released. Scenarios detailed for the User Story are part of the acceptance criteria of the story. 

<Main Scenario>Replace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the main scenario of the user story. Describe the typical usage scenario, as envisaged from a user perspective in a sequence of steps in the following table. As mentioned, the main scenario must necessarily cover the MVP and must always be in sync with the system functionality. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.

<Alternate Scenario 1>Replace the text within < > in the heading above with the name of the alternate scenario. Describe one or more alternate methods that a user can use to achieve the same functionality. Use the following table to elaborate on the alternate scenario. Repeat this section as many times as required for the number of alternate scenarios described.To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.  



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result |
