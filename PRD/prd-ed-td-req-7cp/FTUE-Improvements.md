## June 6th

* Planned a few activities for release by 2 PM:
    *  **Must haves** 
    * In manual onboarding, when user enters a board, medium or class - don't allow users to tap on 'Submit' without atleast selecting one option.
    * Play icon in content-details page to be updated as per design.
    * Telemetry fixes relevant to FTUE have to be done.
    * Remove Sign-in option from Library page for teachers (for blank pages, it's causing the users to assume they should sign-in to really see content).
    * Update Play Store description with latest screenshots - it's showing the old ones currently.

    
    *  **Should haves** 
    * BMC - order of items in drop-down to be corrected.
    * The CTA in language select and user-type selection should slide into screen after user has selected an option.

    

    
* UX and Product have begun work on modifying QR scan screen.
    * UX has requested more info on how many users have scanned QR code from the onboarding page - to understand how relevant that screen is.
