IntroductionNotifications are an excellent way of giving users external reminders to open the app. While intrinsic motivation to use the app is always preferred, in the early days of usage, external motivation is usually required to build the habit of usage. One scalable form of doing so is by using notifications.

Mobile push notifications overviewThe following section primarily deals with setting up of mobile push notifications (specifically on Android, for now).

Mobile notifications - Overall Process Workflow
1. As a user, I install the application and launch it.
1. The device registers with Sunbird servers to receive notifications from the latter. Any permissions needed to enable this are requested from the user.
1. The device requests to listen on particular topics, to receive broadcast notifications.
1. Whenever the Sunbird instance wishes to broadcast notifications to a topic, all devices subscribed to it are informed.
1. Whenever the Sunbird instance wishes to send notifications to a target set of devices, only those devices will be informed.
1. In the cases above, my notifications are maintained in a notifications drawer that I can access at any time from the app.
1. I also can see a notification banner for every new notification that I'm receiving from the Sunbird service.
1. From time to time, renewal of device registration with Sunbird servers to receive notifications should be done.

Mobile notifications - As a Sunbird admin, I require to have the latest information to send notifications to the mobile deviceWhen the user launches the app on the mobile device, we need to send any updates to the server in order to send push notifications reliably.

Main ScenarioUser launches the mobile app, and updated notification token (if any) is shared with server.



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User launches mobile app | Device checks to see if the token to send notifications has expired, and sends an update accordingly.The updated token is stored in the device database, in a sufficiently encrypted/protected format.If the language in app has changed, it is stored in device database. | 

Alternate Scenario 1 - User doesn't launch the mobile app, and the token expires but the local notification system is still activeWhen the local notification system is activated, the device checks if the token has expired, and if so sends the update to the server.



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User doesn't act, but receives a local notification to open the app. | App wakes up, checks if the notification token has expired, and sends an update to server accordingly. | 

Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | App launches, but device is offline. | The app attempts to send the notification token to server, but since there's no acknowledgement - it remembers to do so when connection is established with the server. | 
|  | App sends notification token update to the server, but no acknowledgement is received. | App waits for a TTL (10 minutes for now - as app session might still be active), and tries again. | 
|  | Local notification/alarm wakes the app up, but device is offline and update can't be sent. | The app waits for a TTL (randomly selected between 12-24 hours) and tries again. Using a random selection, since the server can get flooded with update calls since almost all mobile devices are synced to the right time and the local notification can happen for all devices simultaneously. | 
|  | App language was sent to server, but no acknowledgement was received. | The app waits until it is launched again, and resends the app language to the server. |

Mobile notifications - As a Sunbird admin, I should be able to broadcast a notification to usersAs a Sunbird admin, there might be important information that needs to be broadcast to all users (e.g. Sunbird instance will be down next week between 9-11 AM). I should be able to inform all users about it.

Main ScenarioSunbird admin sends the broadcast notification to all users.



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Admin uploads parameters for the notification in various supported languages:
1. Title
1. Body
1. Icon (optional)
1. Banner image (optional)
1. Action link (optional)
    1. Update app - Play Store link
    1. Course registered/started - Course ID
    1. Try content - Content ID
    1. Book updated - Book ID
    1. FAQ updated - FAQ page(+section ID)
    1. Survey request - Google Form link ( **EXTERNAL URL** )
    1. Informational video - YouTube link ( **EXTERNAL URL** )

    

 | Notification (payload) is ready and validated. | 
|  | Sunbird admin sends broadcast notification on a topic | All devices subscribed to that topic should receive the notification, in their app language.Sunbird admin gets mail with the details of the target audience, and notification payload along with notification ID. | 

Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | Notification is sent, but device is offline. | No action needed as this is handled automatically by GCM (until expiry of message). | 
|  | Notification is sent, but sending fails (due to expired message, since device was offline for too long). | No action for now. We'll consider handling this in a later release. | 
|  | Notification is sent, but sending fails (due to expired token) | No action for now. Device sends updated token at next launch, and notifications after that should work fine. |

Mobile notifications - As a user, I should receive a notification on my deviceAs a user, I would like to be notified when there's an important update from the Sunbird instance I use. I might also welcome the occasional nudges to try out new and exciting content, or information about new app versions that are available.

Main ScenarioUser receives a notification from server.



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | (Optional) User notices new notification in mobile notifications drawer. This can include:<ul><li>Icon</li><li>Text</li><li>Banner image</li><li>Action Bar (<Action>, DETAILS)</li></ul> | User taps on notification. | 
|  | User taps on:
1. General notification body
1. Action bar (<Action> button)
1. Action bar (DETAILS button)

 | As per action:
1. User is taken to the notification panel inside app, and the corresponding notification is highlighted.
1. User is directly taken to the action (e.g. App on Play Store page, content details page, courses page, External URL etc.)

 | 
|  | If the user doesn't arrive via the device notifications drawer, then the user launches the app. | User sees the notification icon highlighted. | 
|  | User taps on notification icon. | User sees the latest new notifications.Whenever user closes the notification panel, all indications of new notifications are removed and they are marked as read. | 
|  | User taps on a notification that has an action associated (or directly on the action itself) | User takes the action (e.g. goes to Play Store, content details/courses page, External URL etc.) | 
|  | User swipes left/right on notification | Notification is removed from inside the app drawer. | 
|  | User taps on 'Clear' on top of notification panel. | All notifications are cleared from device. If any are there in the Android notifications drawer, those are also removed. | 
|  | User presses back button (on device/screen), or taps on bottom nav bar. | Notification panel is closed (and if bottom tab is tapped, that is opened). | 

Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User is on an older version of Android, which requires permission to be requested. | The user sees a permissions info popup mentioning why notifications are useful, and the general permissions flow comes into effect.If user denies permission, the notification token is not updated on server side and the device can't be contacted. (This can also happen if user disables notifications from the Android app settings). | 
|  | User receives multiple notifications with the same content | Only the latest version should be kept. | 
|  | User receives an erroneous notification (assume spelling mistake), and later receives the correct notification (I'm assuming we have some sort of notification IDs to fix old notifications). | The updated notification is only kept on the device. | 
|  | User sends a notification by mistake, and then sends a blank notification (with the same notif ID) to remove it. | The notification doesn't show up in the app's notification drawer. | 
|  | User receives an erroneous notification, then goes offline (during which the corrected notification arrives). | User sees the erroneous notification.When they go online, they will see an updated notification in their notification panel - which shows the corrected notification (erroneous notification has been updated). |
