IntroductionAs a teacher/student, I would like to see content linked to a DIAL code in my book in a structured format. If there is a lot of content (For e.g. a textbook level DIAL code), it would be good to select a chapter to jump to the content most relevant to me.

JTBDUse this section  to elaborate on:


*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** User scans a DIAL code, and wants to consume content contextual to what they're studying at the moment. If the user scans a book-level code or a code which has a lot of branches and content under it, then it's hard to find the right content that I want right now. As a user, I'd like to quickly find the most relevant content from the current scan for me to consume right away.
*  **User Personas:**   [Teacher](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Teacher), [Student](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/1030127844/User+Personas+India+public+school+education#UserPersonas(Indiapublicschooleducation)-Student)
*  **System or Environment:**  Mostly home, some likelihood of being in school.

Requirement SpecificationsThis section consists of requirement specifications for specific use cases in the User JTBD. The requirements for each use case are elaborated in detail through sub-sections for:


* Use case overview
* Overall process workflow
* Associated user stories 
* Non-functional requirements
* Localization requirements  
* Telemetry requirements
* Dependencies
* Impact on other products
* Impact on existing data  

OverviewAs a user, I might scan a QR code and find a lot of content linked to it. It would be good to see it categorized neatly, so I can quickly jump to the section most relevant to me.

Overall Process Workflow
1. User scans a DIAL code with a lot of content attached to it.
1. User sees the list of content associated with the DIAL code.
1. User taps on the Select Chapter row.
1. User sees the relevant sections associated with this DIAL code only.
1. User taps on the section of interest and the user is taken to the start of that section in the flattened DIAL result.



Single Unit linked to DIAL - OverviewUser scans a high-level DIAL Code and wants to jump to a specific sub-section within that.

Main Scenario



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User scans DIAL code (preferably at a level as close to root as possible) | User sees a flattened set of DIAL results. | 
|  | User taps on 'Select Chapter' | User sees the section of the TOC directly under this DIAL code only.The closest node/sub-section of the first fully visible content card is highlighted, and visible atleast a couple of rows from the top of the screen. (This rule can be ignored if there aren't enough rows to fill the screen)Each top-level chapter has separators, and the corresponding header styles should apply based on section. **The 'SELECT CHAPTER' UI inside the textbook should also be exactly the same as this.**  | 
|  | User selects one of the section headers | The user is taken to the first content within the section header immediately. | 

Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User taps on a section that's 'Coming Soon' | User should be taken back to the flattened results DIAL screen at the exact same offset as before, and a popup with the tenant specific 'Coming soon' message for the book should be displayed. |

For Future ReleaseA results screen that looks exactly in the same format, whether you opened the textbook or scanned the DIAL code.

Multiple Units, Books or Content linked to DIAL - OverviewUser scans a high-level DIAL Code which is linked to:


* Collection/book units from different collections/books.
* Multiple books/collections
* Content from different collections/books.
* Any permutations of the above (book units and books, books and individual content etc.)

For history, refer to  **PRD - ETB Consumption** 

Main Scenario

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User scans DIAL code that is linked to multiple books | User sees an intermediate results page - which has the list of books that are linked to the DIAL code. | 
|  | User selects one of the books | User sees the flattened list of content as per above story. | 
|  | User presses BACK | User sees the intermediate results page. | 

Alternate Scenario 1 - Multiple book units linked to DIAL code

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User scans DIAL code that is linked to textbook units within two or more different books | User sees the intermediate results page - which has the list of books that are linked to the DIAL code. Since the DIAL code is linked to a textbook unit within each book, the title of the respective textbook units is displayed under the book card. | 
|  | User selects one of the books | User sees the flattened list of content from the linked textbook unit. (If this is a mobile/desktop app, then the spine is downloaded in the background). | 
|  | User presses BACK | User sees the intermediate results page. | 

Alternate Scenario 2 - Multiple resources linked to DIAL code

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User scans DIAL code that is linked to individual contents within two or more different books | User sees the intermediate results page - which has the list of books that are linked to the DIAL code. Since the DIAL code is linked to a resource within each book, the title of the respective resources is displayed under the book card. | 
|  | User selects one of the books | User sees the content details page for that specific content that's linked. (If this is a mobile/desktop app, then the spine is downloaded in the background). | 
|  | User presses BACK | User sees the intermediate results page. | 

Alternate Scenario 3 - Multiple types of content linked to DIAL code

| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User scans DIAL code that is linked to a resource from one book, a textbook unit from a second book, a third book etc. | User sees the intermediate results page - which has the list of books that are linked to the DIAL code. Since the DIAL code is linked to a textbook unit from one book and a resource from another, the title of the respective textbook unit/resource is displayed under the book card for those two books. | 
|  | User selects one of the books | a. If linked to a textbook unit or a book - User sees the flattened list of content from the linked textbook unit.b. If linked to a content - User sees the content details page.(If this is a mobile/desktop app, then the spine is downloaded in the background). | 
|  | User presses BACK | User sees the intermediate results page. | 

Exception ScenariosDescribe a list of exception scenarios in the following table and how they are handled. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.   



| Srl. No. | Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | User taps on a book unit from the intermediate results page, but the unit that's linked is empty | User sees the relevant 'Content Coming Soon' popup. Closing it will continue to show the intermediate results page. | 
|  | DIAL code is linked to a book and to a course | Keep calm and don't panic. This is  **NOT**  supposed to happen. Even so, just show the intermediate results page with the book style cards. For the course result, show the title of it in the book title, and if there is no subject for this - show the topic (if available) in the subject's place. If there is a class, show the class. |
