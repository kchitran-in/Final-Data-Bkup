# End users

## Teacher
Age range: (21-55)

Most Indian government school teachers are not very active explorers of the digital world. Their internet journey has recently begun with the explosion of affordable internet access in India. The apps they are currently aware of using are WhatsApp, YouTube and to some extent, Facebook. 

While sensitive about their internet usage (under 1 GB a day), they are a lot more sensitive about the usage of disk space on their phone. Most of the disk space is slowly taken up by WhatsApp attachments, and not as easy to clear away.

Many of them increase the font size on their phone, so its easier to read. (More prominent with the older segment).

Their first choice of written language while using apps is in the vernacular (local language predominant in the region). They can read/write English, but aren't as comfortable in using it.




## Student
Age range: (6-16)

Most students do not have access to a digital device. Approximately 20% of them might have access via a parent (predominantly the father).

They aren't afraid of technology (or experimenting with various aspects of the phone, including phone settings).

They can be impatient as they might not fully comprehend why downloads/loading take time, and might occasionally keep cancelling and reattempting downloads.

# A tale of two extremes
The following personas are the hero and anti-hero to our user stories. The names are purely chosen for comic relief and are not due to any coincidence. They could be replaced with  _s1g2d!g_  and  _y6g9k)h_  if needed.


## Ram
Ram is our happy-path user. He represents the user who goes from point A to point B without any deviation with a sole single-minded focus of completing the task, while having in his/her possession:


* The best mobile device
* 1 Gbps internet connection
* Always accessible internet
* Unlimited usage plan
* 1 TB of mobile disk space


## Shyam
Shyam is the user most struck by Murphy's law. He has taken upon himself (at the suggestion of ) to achieve the outcome despite every possible challenge that's thrown at him. He represents every user who will struggle at some point or the other with the software provided despite his/her intents (best or otherwise).  **HE'S A PAIN TO BUILD FOR** . But it's his heroic persistence that motivates us to make our software resilient. In his possession is:


* The lowest supported mobile device - running Android 5 (Our extent of supporting Android 4.4+ is only based on what Crosswalk enables on our existing software. No further investment will happen currently beyond that.)
* 256 kbps internet connection (can go lower)
* Intermittent internet, going offline majority of the time
* 100 MB usage/month (and beyond that FUP, has miraculously gotten access to 80 kbps unlimited access. Joy to the world.)
* 75 MB free disk space
