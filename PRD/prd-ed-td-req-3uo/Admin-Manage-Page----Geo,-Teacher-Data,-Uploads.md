JTBD


*  **Jobs To Be Done:** 

A new ‘Manage’ page needs to be provided to anchor access to the various datasets that a state admin can view/ manage. These include:
1. Geo data: View details of geo(org) data that has been successfully created for the state
1. View details of validated state teacher accounts created in the state tenant.
1. Manage and view details of the Shadow (reference) DB - this section is made available only if SSO integration is not enabled for the state

This page will be accessible only by the state admin (Tenant admin role) - and will be accessed from a ‘Manage’ link in the Portal drop-down menu which is a link that only the state admin will be shown

Requirement Specifications


*  **Overall process workflow** 



>> The 3 sections (as specified above) will be displayed in a 'summary format' (totals) on the manage page

>> Clicking on the 'more' will open an expanded view in a new tab

>> The expanded view will have : 

Schools aggregated at the district level for the section on Geo data

Teachers aggregated at the district level for the section on Validated teacher data

>> The "User List upload" will show only for states that do not have SSO integration enabled. This section allows a state admin to 

a. Upload a new list of users into the Shadow DB

b. See a summary of the shadow DB - total user records uploaded (for state) onto shadow DB, records that have been validated, records that were Rejected by users, records that failed, as well as records in the shadow DB that have duplicates (for phone number/ email IDs). Clicking on each of the links enables the admin to download a csv file of Validated, Rejected or Failed, Invalid user entries in order to check. (see wireframes doc for list of variables in the files that are downloaded)

*  **Telemetry requirements** 

Basic telemetry to be able to track how many people visit the page, how many downloads are carried out from the page

WIREFRAMES ::
