IntroductionCurrently, most of the teachers receive a paper attendance certificate post completion of the in-person training programs conducted by the state. In some states, teachers submit these certificates back to the school principal as a proof of attending the training program. Hence, they do not have a record of the trainings attended by them. Further, the paper certificates are liable to forgery and can be misused by the stakeholders to meet certain ends.



Teachers deem a certificate provided by a valid authority as an important artefact:


* serves as an evidence of completing a training
* collection of multiple certificates can potentially build teachers' learning profile
* permanence of the certificate since it is in a digitised format
* verifiability of certificates reduces the chances of forgery

Hence, the value of including this use case as an integral part of the teacher's online course journey.

1. print and ship certificates to teachers

Overall Process Workflow

![](images/storage/Certificate%20WorkFlow_v1.1%20(1).png)

User Story 1 OverviewAs a course author, for the course authored by me, I want to configure course completion certificate to be issued upon completion of the course.

Main Scenario

Assertion of a certificate to a course will be done using a API from the back end. API will be used to carry out the following functions:

1) Associate a certificate template to the course

2) Update existing course certificate <if the certificate is already set>

3) Remove association between certificate and the course

A certificate can have the following components:



|  **Name**  |  **Description**  |  **Optional/Mandatory**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| Completion date | will be the <month, year> when the teacher completed the training | System populated | 
| Issuer | will be the state body issuing the certificate (organization or institution) | Mandatory | 
| Recipient | will be the teacher name who has completed the course | System populated | 
| Signatory | will be name of the individual signing the certificate  | Optional | 
| Signature | will be the digital signature image of the signatory | Optional | 
| Training program name | will be the name of the course which they have completed | System populated | 
| QR code | Will be unique per user | System populated | 



Mapping of Components


* A state can have single unique issuer.


* Certificate can have single signature. The signature will be digitally verified.
* Issuer can have multiple signatories. 


* Each certificate will have unique QR code. 


* QR code mapping can be updated dynamically i.e., if a QR code is linked to user’s credentials it can later be updated to have a video or both.



The structural model for certification infra needs to be built on incredible spec. ([https://github.com/sunbird-specs/inCredible/blob/master/v1/spec.md](https://github.com/sunbird-specs/inCredible/blob/master/v1/spec.md))

Pre-requisites


* Course is published


* Course has batches - batch can be an open batch or an invite only batch.


* Certificate template is available


* State has provided the details needed to assert the certificate


* Each state has their own public and private key generated by platform





| Srl. No. | User Action (API) | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | Attach a certificate template to a course which does not have any certificates attached | Certificate template to be added to the course | 
| 2 | Attach certificate to a course which already has a certificate attached | Should fail with proper error message - This course already has a certificate attached to it.  | 
| 3 | Update certificate to a course which has a certificate attached | The updated certificate will be added to the course | 
| 4 | Remove attached certificate from a course | Attached certificate will be disassociated | 
| 5 | Update/Remove certificate when no certificate is attached to a course | Should fail with proper error message - This course does not have a certificate attached to it. | 

Exception Scenarios

When issuing certificates to users, any changes to the certificate template will not be applied retrospectively. The latest certificate template at the time of issue/re-issue is provided to the users. Certificate Templatespossible certificate templates are shown in the below link

[https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/18060916](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/projects/prototypes/18060916)For Future Release

As a course creator, I want to assert certificates to courses created by me so that users receive the certificate upon course completion.

State can have multiple unique issuers.

User Story 2 OverviewAs a course mentor, I want to issue online certificates to my state teachers who have completed the course.

Pre Requisites


* Course has a certificate attached to it


* User is enrolled into the course batch (open or invite-only)


* User's course progress is 100%


* User belongs to the same tenant as the course author (only state validated teachers receive the certificate)

Main Scenarios

Issuance of certificates to state teachers who have completed the course will be done using a API. 

Scenario 1: Issue certificates to all state teachers who have completed the course



|  **Sr. No**  |  **User Action (API)**  |  **Expected Result**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1) | Issue certificate API | If pre-requisites are met then certificates are successfully issued. If certificate was already issued to the teacher then it is not issued again.Upon successful issue of certificate, the recipients are notified by SMS or email or both. The count of issued certificates is updated in the mentor's course dashboard.If certificate issue fails, a log of failed records and the reason for failure is stored in the log. | 

Alternate Scenarios

Scenario: Re-issue of certificates

Pre Requisites


* User has already received a certificate





|  **Sr. No**  |  **User Action (API)**  |  **Expected Result**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1) | Re-issue certificate API | If pre-requisites are met then certificates are successfully re-issued. Upon successful re-issue of certificate, the recipients are notified by SMS or email or both. The count of issued certificates is NOT updated in the mentor's course dashboard. (this count maps to the users who have received the certs irrespective of the number of times they have been issued the same certificate)If certificate issue fails, a log of failed records and the reason for failure is stored in the log. |

User Story OverviewAs a course mentor, I want to issue online certificates to my state teachers who have completed the course.

Pre Requisites


* Course batch (open or invite-only) has ended


* Course has a certificate attached to it


* User is enrolled into the course batch (open or invite-only)


* User's course progress is 100%


* Certificate issuer is either the course mentor for that batch or in case of open batch should be the author of the course with course mentor role


* User belongs to the same tenant as the course author (only state validated teachers receive the certificate)

Main Scenarios



Scenario 1: Issue certificates to all state teachers who have completed the course (Bulk issue)



|  **Sr. No**  |  **User Action**  |  **Expected Result**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1) | Course mentor clicks on ‘Issue online certificates’ option for the first time | Certificates are issued to teachers who have completed the course
1. A pop up is shown with a message informing the user that ‘Certificates will be issued to <count> teachers shortly.’ (Exact message to be provided by the documentation team).


1. System initiates certificate issuance process in async mode


1. ‘Issue online certificate’ option is disabled


1. From the course dashboard report, mentor can visually identify teachers who have received the certificate vs who have not.


1. Post successful issue of certs, mentor can see the count of teachers who have received the certs in the dashboard. If the certificate issuance has failed then display the count of certificates that were not issued


1. ‘Issue online certificate’ option is enabled



 | 
| 2 | Course mentor clicks on ‘Issue online certificates’ option again |  **If the bulk issue of certificates was already done:** 
1. New certs to be issued:



Certificates are issued to users who have not received the certificate previously for whatever reason. Steps mentioned in user action 1) are repeated.2. If there are no new certificates to be issued:User is informed that <No new certificates are to be issued. Certificates were already issued to <count> teachers on <DD-MM-YY-HH-MM-SS>> (Exact message to be provided by the documentation team) | 



Scenario 2: Re-issue certificates to only a few selected state teachers who have completed the course



| Srl. No. | User Action | Expected Result | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | Course mentor selects users (either by search or manually) in the course dashboard page and re-issues certificate | Certificates are issued to selected teachers
1. A pop up is shown with a message informing the user that ‘Certificates will be issued to <count> teachers shortly.’ (Exact message to be provided by the documentation team).
1. System initiates new certificate issuance process in async mode (re-issues are treated as new certificate issuance)
1. From the course dashboard report mentor can visually identify teachers who have received the certificate vs who have not.
1. Post successful issue of certs, the count of number of teachers who have received the certificates is updated, if need be. (count should not be duplicated).  If the certificate issuance has failed then display the count of certificates that were not issued

 | 

Exception Scenarios

Scenario 1:

The course dashboard UI can show only 10k users. Hence, if a batch has more than 10k users then not every teacher who has enrolled into the course shows up in the dashboard report. Hence, in this scenario, the mentor may not be able to re-issue certificates to a few teachers. 



In this scenario, course mentor can filter the course dashboard view by course completion date and issue certificates.



|  **Srl. No.**  |  **User Action**  |  **Expected Result**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1 | Course mentor selects users (either by search or manually) in the course dashboard page by applying completion date filter and re-issues certificate | Certificates are issued to selected teachers
1. A pop up is shown with a message informing the user that ‘Certificates will be issued to <count> teachers shortly.’ (Exact message to be provided by the documentation team).
1. System initiates certificate issuance process in async mode
1. From the course dashboard report mentor can visually identify teachers who have received the certificate vs who have not.
1. Post successful issue of certs, the count of number of teachers who have received the certificates is updated, if need be. (count should not be duplicated).  If the certificate issuance has failed then display the count of certificates that were not issued

## User Story 9
JIRA Ticket ID[SB-14845 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-14845)

As a course creator, for the courses created by me, I should be able to attach more than one certificate template to a course so that users receive different certificates based on the defined filter criteria for each template. For example, a teacher who completed the course with less than 80% score in the assessments will get a completion certificate. However a teacher who completed the course with more than 80% score in the course assessments will get a merit certificate.

Pre Requisites


* Course is published
* Course has batches - batch can be an open batch or an invite only batch
* Certificate templates are available
* State has provided the details needed to assert the certificate
* Issuing authority/Issuer name - The issuer will be an organisation or institution which is a competent authority to certify recipients. Note that the issuer is different from the signatory (i.e. the individual(s) who applies his/her signature to the credential). 
* Signatory - will be the name, designation of the individual/authority signing the certificate. 
* Signature image - will be the digital signature image of the signatory. 
* Each state has their own public and private key generated by platform
* Define the filter criterion for these templates (Progress (100%) + Assessment Score (<80%) to get completion certificate and) Progress (100%) + Assessment Score (>80%) to get merit certificate)
* The assessment score is calculated as the best of attempt score recorded against content type 'Assessment' 



Main Scenario

Assertion of a certificate to a course will be done using a API from the back end. API will be used to carry out the following functions:

1) Associate a certificate template to the course

2) Update existing course certificate <if the certificate is already set>

3) Remove association between certificate and the course

Certificate Templates

<To be added>


## User Story 10
JIRA Ticket ID[SB-14846 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-14846)

As a course mentor, for a course which has more than one template, I want to issue online certificates to my state teachers based on the filter criterion for the course. For example, if a course has two certificate templates. Criteria for one template is course progress should be 100% and criteria to receive second template is course progress of 100% plus assessment score of more than 80%.

Pre Requisites


* Course has more than one certificate attached to it


* Course certificate templates have the filter criterion rules defined
* User is enrolled into the course batch (open or invite-only)


* User meets the filter criterion


* User belongs to the same tenant as the course author (only state validated teachers receive the certificate)

Main Scenarios

Issuance of certificates to state teachers who have met the criterion will be done using a API. 

Scenario 1:



|  **Sr. No** 

 |  **User Action (API)** 

 |  **Expected Result** 

 | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 1) | Issue certificate API | If pre-requisites are met then certificates are successfully issued.Users get the certificate template based on the filter criteria met by them.If certificate was already issued to the teacher then it is not issued again.Upon successful issue of certificate, the recipients are notified by SMS or email or both. The count of issued certificates is updated in the mentor's course dashboard.If certificate issue fails, a log of failed records and the reason for failure is stored in the log. | 

Scenario 2:

Lets say a course has one assessment with 10 questions created with content type as 'Assessment' and some reading material. 

User 1 has attempted the assessment thrice and has scored 6,7 and 8 but has not completed the course by batch end date.

Certificate status: Will not receive any certificate (not completed the course)

User 2 has attempted the assessment thrice and has scored 4,5 & 5 but has completed the course before batch end date.

Certificate status: Will receive completion certificate (in all the 3 attempts his score was less than 80%)

User 3 has attempted the assessment four times and has scored 8, 2, 3 & 1 but has completed the course before batch end date.

Certificate status: Will receive merit certificate (best of attempt score indicates that in the first attempt user has scored 80%)

If the course has more than one assessment then the scores will be averaged out to calculate the user's final assessment score.

 **Note:** 

For courses which have more than one certificate template, certificates will be issued at the end of the batch. This is to avoid users receiving multiple certificates for the same course.

The assessment score is calculated as the best of attempt score recorded against content type 'Assessment'.  


## User Story 11 - Send Email and SMS to the user, when "Certificate of Achievement" is issued 
JIRA Ticket ID[SB-15844 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-15844)

 **Context:** 

Once a user completes an online course with more than a specified %, a Certificate of Achievement is issued. This certificate is different from the course completion certificate (which is issued for just completing the course). A user can only get either a completion or Merit certificate and not both.

So, when a user completes a course with a certain set %, there should be an email/SMS notification informing the user that the Certificate of Achievement is generated and that it can be downloaded from the Profile page. If user's profile has both email and mobile number, then notification on the same goes to both email address and mobile number. If the user has provided only his/her mobile number, notification is sent only to the mobile or if the user has provided only his/her email address, notification is sent only to the email address

Note: The email and SMS text that is sent to the user for receiving Course completion or Certificate of Achievement should be the same going forward. The differentiation between the two should be made available in the actual Certificate

 **As a teacher, I want to be alerted via an email or SMS as soon as I receive the Certificate of Achievement/Course completion so that I'm aware that I can now download my certificate.** 

 **Acceptance criteria:** 

 **Pre-condition:** 

# User has completed the course with merit (Score % >=set %) / without merit
