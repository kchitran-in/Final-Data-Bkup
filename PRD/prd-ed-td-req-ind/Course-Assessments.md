IntroductionThe current platform capability enables creators to create practice questions, add them into courses and enable users to learn and practice. There has been an increasing number of asks from states to enable them to judge competency levels of teachers after completing an unit or all units in the course so that they can reward the teachers who have met the criteria set by the state.

To address these problems, in the next couple of releases, we are proposing changes to the platform to provide an opportunity for the course creators & stakeholders to a) gauze the content quality and b) validate teacher's learning.

At a high level, the objective of this work stream is to integrate assessments as a key TPD course component thereby enabling:


* course creators to design courses which include evaluation of learners’ understanding
* course creators to configure course assessments per their pedagogical needs 
* users to consume the course assessments per the defined configurations
* course mentors to view learners’ assessment performance and provide interventions

Creation of course assessments - User Story 1 OverviewAs a content creator, I should be able to create and publish question sets within a course which are consumed as self-assessments by users enrolled in courses.

 **Prerequisites:** 


1. Should have creation rights

 **Workflow:**   

 **Creation of self-assessments** 

Step1: Course assessments will be created and published as practice question set:


1. Creator to include a instruction slide manually
1. Creator to include the summary plugin the last slide

Step2: Tag the practice question sets as content type 'Self Assess'


1. Backend script is run to change the content type to 'Self Assess'

Step3: Course creator adds the assessment to course ToC page


1. New type called 'Self Assessment' will be displayed when the creator clicks on 'Add Resource'

 **Editing the published self-assessments** 

Editing the questions will follow the current process



 **Note:** 


1. Content type ‘Self Assess’ should not be discoverable under resources/library for content consumers

DesignsExisting program portal will be customized per the above workflow

Creation of Self Assessment from Workspace - User Story 2 OverviewJIRA Ticket ID[SB-15838 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-15838)

 **Context** 

Currently an Assessment is created as a two step process and most of the activities are done in the back end. A content is created with type as "Resource" which is reviewed and published and later the content type is changed to "Self-Assess” and made available to the user. Instead, the whole creation and publishing process should happen from the portal, without back end team's support 

 **As a Content creator, I should be able to create and publish a Course-Assessment, So that it can be used in a Course for consumption** 

 **Acceptance criteria** 

 **Pre-conditions** 


1. Logged in user has access to create content



 **Workflow to enable 'Self Assess' in the workspace** 


1. The option to create 'Self Assess' content type questions is not enabled by default to all tenants.
1. This content type has to be enabled on request basis
1. This option will be enabled by the implementation team 

 **Main Workflow** 

Verify that


1. User is able to see an option ("Course Assessment") in the work space to create "Self - Assess" content


1. Self Assess creation process is similar to the resource creation process (Refer UI design)


1. The Summary plug in automatically gets created. This should be displayed for the user in preview, review mode and also after it gets published. There is no need for the creator to manually add it in the third slide during creation
1. The below gets displayed in the preview mode
    1. Instructions (if it exists)
    1. Questions
    1. Summary details
    1. Score details

    
1. The "Self - Assess" content goes through the existing Save, Review, Preview and Publish workflows - Draft, All my content, Submitted for Review, Published, Up for Review. Note: The existing table/card structure display (as applicable) will be retained for these views with the content type name shown as "Course Assessment"
1. The "Self-Assess" content can be updated and re-published similar to Resources
1. The "Self-Assess" content is not available under Library/Resources for content consumers

 **Exceptional workflow** 

The older Self Assess content will retain the existing behavior

Edit details page for Assessment is not included in the invision link. Hence calling this out separately

## Make Course Assessment creation completely self serviceable - User story 4 Overview
JIRA Ticket ID[SB-17589 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-17589)

 **Context:** 

This is in continuation to SB-15838. Course Assessments currently support only MCQ template. This should be extended to the remaining templates as well - Match the following, Fill in the blanks, Reordering words, Arrange in sequence.

    1. "Show Immediate Feedback" is disabled by default, However the user can choose to enable, if required
    1. "Display" option should be disabled/removed

    
1. Note: The created Course Assessment (content type "Self-Assess") should be available in All my content, Draft, Submitted for Review, Up for Review, Published sections as it exists today. There are no changes to the current behavior
1. The above (Sl.no:1-3) criteria holds good even while editing the Assessment
1. Every question with a right or wrong answer is considered as "attempted". Anything left blank or answered and later removed/left blank is considered as "skipped"

 **Refer the below screen shots for reference** .
