## Sample or Reference Questions
MCQTestJune2020

Default font size fits well for a few words. Guess maybe eight to ten words or maybe even with more words. I think it fits well with as many as twenty-two words

This is the second answer with about fourteen words each one with a few characters

Question takes a default font size of eighteen and so does an option

User can change the font size as required from a range of 18 - 28
