IntroductionBy tracking the courses funnel on the mobile app, we realise that out of the 100% clicking on a specific course card, only 12% are clicking on enroll. Out of that, only 7% are completing the enrollment after signing in. These are fairly dismal numbers. While we see an increase in the numbers when the state makes courses mandatory, it isn't close to ideal. 

Post enroling, % of users starting the course, and resuming the course after starting is fairly dismal. Field research seems to prove that this is an issue with the intuitiveness of the page. Users are unable to understand what action to perform next when they look at the details page. This PRD tackles that. 

JTBD
*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** As the State who is launching a course for teachers, I want teachers to be able to enrol into the course easily, so that I can ensure they have taken the course in order to upskill themselves. 
*  **User Personas:** Government School Teacher
*  **System or Environment:**  At home or in school using their mobile phone

<User chooses to enroll into the course> Overview

< User chooses to enroll into the course - Overall Process Workflow>The state will launch courses by issuing QR codes on a circular. These circulars will be made available to teachers in schools via the circular. Teachers are expected to scan the QR code, enrol and take the course. On completion of the course, they will be provided with a certificate.
