IntroductionThis document details out the licensing, copyright, credits and attribution details that are to be shown in courses. The main intent of these changes is to make sure:

a) we are compliant with the legal requirements &

Requirement SpecificationsUse Case 1 OverviewThis use case deals with the additional attributes that are to be entered by the author when creating a course and how to show these to the users who are consuming the course.



User Story 1 (Portal) **Scenario 1:** A new course is created on DIKSHA. Course content (Resources) is authored by state teachers.

 **Scenario 3:**  A new course is created on DIKSHA. Course content (Resources) is a mixture of 3rd party content and state owned content

In all these scenarios following details are to be provided by the creator when creating the course: (these are the new fields to be introduced in the course meta data form API)


1. Course Author - The person or organization who has authored the content. If the author herself is creating the content on DIKSHA, she can give her name. But if a different person has created the content and do not have access to DIKSHA, the person creating the content on DIKSHA should provide the original author’s name. This is a free flowing text and is mandatory.
1. Rename 'OWNER' to 'COPYRIGHT' **:**

User Story 6 - Ability to select the appropriate license from the DLL, during course creationJIRA Ticket ID[SB-15980 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-15980)

 **Context:** 

Currently DIKSHA supports only one license when a content is created or uploaded onto DIKSHA. However, NCERT and content providers like Khan Academy have different license types (such as CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-SA-NC etc.). Hence it is required that DIKSHA support multiple types of licenses for content. However all the licenses should comply to CC framework. A content creator within a state should be able to select the appropriate license for the course while creating a course (though a course consists of multiple contents and each content could correspond to a specific license).

 **Update added on 11th Dec 2019** 

A part of the requirement is already done as part of Resources and hence the only thing left now would be to add a static text at the bottom of the screen

 **As a Course creator, I would want to be able to see a static consent text during course creation, So that i am aware that by selecting the license type, i am providing my consent for the same** 

 **Acceptance criteria:** 

 **Pre-conditions:** 


1. Logged in user has access to create a course


1. Logged in user is in the process of course creation and is in the Edit details screen



 **Verify that:** 

 **Main Workflow:** 


1. There is a static text at the bottom as following -

    “By creating any type of content on DIKSHA, you consent to publish it under the Creative Commons License Framework <[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)> Please choose the applicable
