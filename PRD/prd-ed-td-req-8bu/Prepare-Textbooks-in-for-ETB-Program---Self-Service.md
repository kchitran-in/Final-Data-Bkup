IntroductionThis document describes requirements for Managing Textbooks in a Program. This is one of the steps of "Programs driven Content sourcing". Following diagram depicts L1 and L2 flows of the overall program driven content sourcing flow.

[https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ky31DBw=/?moveToWidget=3074457347130847117](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ky31DBw=/?moveToWidget=3074457347130847117)

Once "Create Contribution Program", and "Onboard Textbook Creators and Reviewers" are done, it is Textbook creator who shall be authorized to create or manage Textbooks under the defined scope. Currently this process happens through back-end configuration. This document details the requirements to enable this process to happen on the system (portal), so that Textbook creators can do it  without involving any support. This is required to support this at scale for use in ETB.

JTBD
*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** As a Textbook creator, I want to make Textbooks ready for contribution in the ETB Program as per the defined scope.
*  **User Personas:**  Textbook creator is typically a tech aware person assigned by state to work on creating and managing ETBs. They interact with subject matter experts and teachers to source content and link to the textbooks.

Requirement SpecificationsOverall Process WorkflowFollowing are prerequisites for this process:


* ETB Program is created for the given tenant.
* List of B, M, G, S that are in scope for this ETB program are defined
* Textbook creators are configured of the program
