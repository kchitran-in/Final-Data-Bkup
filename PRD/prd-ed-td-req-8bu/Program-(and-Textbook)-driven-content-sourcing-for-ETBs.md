IntroductionContent Sourcing of ETB is the step of ETB process where states pool existing content from various sources or create new content relevant to the textbooks that are part of their ETB program scope. 

Following are the different ways content is sourced for ETB:


1. Upload existing content (pdfs, videos or html)
1. Reuse existing DIKSHA content
1. Create new content

However this content sourcing process is not textbook driven. The content is uploaded/created, reviewed and published outside the scope of ETB. Once published, they are linked to the relevant textbooks. This results in multiple issues:


1. Content contributors  do not have the right context when they create or upload content, resulting in content that may not be very relevant.
1. Content contributors have to explicitly tag the content with relevant board, medium, class,  subjects and topics based on the textbook for which the content is created.
1. ETB program administrators cannot track the progress of ETB - number of contents that are getting created, reviewed for each textbook.

To solve the above problems, the solution is to enable content contributors to contribute content (upload existing or create new) based on Textbooks under program scope. This process has been enabled as an experiment for CBSE. The same has to be enabled for all the states.

JTBDUse this section  to elaborate on:


*  **Jobs To Be Done: ** 
    1. As a content contributor I want to contribute relevant content for the textbooks under program scope. 
    1. As a content reviewer I want to review the content contributed for textbook under program scope.
    1. As a program admin I want to see the over all content dashboard for monitoring.

    
*  **User Personas:**  This story is relevant for Content contributor, content reviewer, program admin.

Requirement Specifications **Pre-requisites:** 


1. A state sets up an ETB program and defines the scope from back-end (same as existing functionality for CBSE).
1. The state configures textbook creators, textbook reviewers, content contributors and content reviewers for the program through back-end.
1. Textbook creators create or add ETBs to the program scope (as defined in the story: [SB-16761 System JIRA](https:///browse/SB-16761)). As long as mentioned story is not implemented, it will be done form back-end.

Contribution can be done either by contributing content to respective node of the textbook or through bulk upload.

Use Case 1: Content contribution for a textbook through bulk upload.Bulk upload option shall be available for a textbook under program. Bulk upload will be done only for a textbook at a time. A new role "Bulk content publisher" will be created in the system and a user with that role can only do Bulk upload and publishing of content. Textbook for which the bulk upload is being done must be in draft state. Multiple bulk upload can be done for a textbook, but not at the same time. Upon successful upload, content would be created, published and linked to relevant section of the textbook as mentioned in bulk upload file.

Key Metrics

| Srl. No. | Metric | Purpose of Metric | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | <ul><li>Total number of bulk upload content requests in given a time period (overall and per tenant)</li><li>Total number contents that are published through bulk upload in given a time period (overall and per tenant)</li><li>Total number bulk upload contents for a Grade (can have multiple subject and multiple textbook)</li><li>Average, Medium, Min and Max time taken for - entire bulk upload process, per content upload</li><li>% of Bulk upload processes - successfully completed, completed with errors, aborted</li><li>Average number of times users download status report per bulk upload process</li></ul> | To have clear view and understanding about the content being uploaded for a textbook and subsequently for a program. It would help to achieve target driven contribution objectives. | 

Validations **General Rules:** 


1. Textbook for which the bulk upload is being done must be in draft state. 
1. Before any validation/processing, space trimming should be done for preceding and trailing value of each cell.
1. Validation must be done before the content creation for each row. For example system should read the entire row, in case any mandatory cell value is missing, fail the content creation for that row and display with error message in status report.  





| Error / Exception | Expected Handling | 
|  --- |  --- | 
|  **Validations at the time of bulk sheet upload (Results in Validation Errors)**  | 
| In case any mandatory column is missing, validation error should be thrown. Mandatory columns: Name of the content,  Audience, Author, Copyright, Icon, File Format, File path, content type, Level 1 Textbook Unit | Error Message to Display:"Following mandatory columns are missing in input sheet: XXX, YYY, ZZZ." | 
| Number of content in input sheet should not be more than 1000.  | Error Message to Display:Input sheet should not have more than 1000 content. | 
|  |  | 
|  **Validations while processing each row for creating each content (Results in Content Creation Failure)**  | 
| In case already successfully uploaded content is being uploaded again. Duplication of content shall be checked on the basis of following parameters:Combination of Channel, Board, Medium, Grade, Subject Content Name should be unique.(Note: Channel, Board, Medium, Grade, Subject values are adopted from the values of Textbook) | System should fail the upload of such content with following error message: "Duplicate Content"   | 
| Validation regarding mandatory fields should be checked while processing each row, in case cell value is missing fail that creation of that content | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Following mandatory fields are missing: XXX, YYY." | 
| File format: Validate the given file is in one of the supported formats by the system (all formats supported through "Upload Content" option of individual content) | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Invalid file format" | 
| Validate given file format matches with format specified in File Format field. If it doesn't match give error | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"File doesn't match with the mentioned format" | 
| File Size: Each content should not be more than 50 MB. | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"File size is more than 50 MB" | 
| Icons and files to be put in google drive and to share google drive links in the respective field. Please ensure Google Drive links are correct and having view access to all permissions. Else give error | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Unable to access file at google link" OR"Unable to access file at google link" | 
| Bulk csv sheet should not have two contents with same following values:Content Name | In case already created content is found again in further rows of the same input sheet, treat it as duplicate and display following error as reason for failure:"Duplicate Content" | 
| Multiple contents in one single row is strictly not allowed. Only one content must be shared in one row. | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Multiple content values in a single row" | 
| Topic field values should follow the framework/taxonomy of the tenant. | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Invalid Topic" | 
| Image icon should not be more than 1 MB and must be in png, jpg/jpeg format | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:for icon image size: "Image icon size is more than 1 MB"for icon image format: "Icon image is not of png, jpg or jpeg format" | 
| Check Textbook hierarchy as given in "Level" columns exist in the given textbook. If not, give error | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Incorrect values in Textbook Levels" | 
| Content Type: Value in Content type field should be one of the values configured in the current program. If not, give error | Error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"Incorrect Content Type" | 
| System Error | This is not a validation error. But, if any system error occurs while processing the content, error message should be displayed in cell of the column "Reason For Failure" as:"System error: <<the error message thrown by the system>>" | 



Assumptions
1. :Level columns in bulk csv file contain textbook unit names.
1. Textbook unit names - There are NO two textbook units with same name and with same hierarchy (levels). In case they are present, system takes the first one to link
1. Topics and Keywords - More than one topics or keywords are separated by commas. They do not contain commas within them


1. Through bulk upload process, the content is always linked to the given textbook. NO content is removed from textbook through this process
1. It is assumed that the textbook for which bulk upload happens is not simultaneously edited using textbook editor during the process. Parallel editing of textbook might delete the linked content through bulk upload
1. In case a row in bulk csv has more than one validation errors, only the first error detected will be given in the error message field
1. Bulk upload process does NOT stop if an error occurs in validation of a specific row or during processing of a specific row. It proceeds with other rows.
1. Board, Medium, Grade, Subject values are taken from corresponding values of Textbook and populated in all the uploaded content.



Use Case 2: Creation of interactive practice questions and linking to ETBs under program scopeCurrently interactive practice questions (MCQs, FTB etc) can be created and published by content editor through work space. We are heading towards program driven content contribution approach where we look forward to create such interactive content under program scope. This use case defines creation, review and linking of interactive contents to textbook under program. User having contribution role for a program can create such content. User having review role for a program can review such content. Upon successful review and acceptance, content shall be published and linked to respective section of textbook. 

 **Prerequisites** :


1. User with contributor role can contribute to program. She must be given contributor role explicitly within the program.
1. User with reviewer role can review the content for a program. She must be given contributor role explicitly within the program.
1. Program, scope of the program, Textbooks set up for contribution & valid user creation for contribution and review should have done prior to contribution.
1. Textbook for which contribution is happening must be in draft state. 

Overall Process WorkflowThe over all workflow process could be broadly viewed in two parts 'contribution' and 'review'.
