Use Case: Defining appropriate licensing, attribution, creation and ownership fields for a content User Story 1: For Content Creation - OverviewThis user story defines the fields (related to licensing, attribution, creation etc)  to be captured at the time of content creation. Story is further segregated into three scenarios.

<Main Scenario> ** ** A new resource (teaching, learning, practice or test content) or Textbook is created on DIKSHA either through uploading a file or using content editor.


* Replace the following existing fields:
    *  Creators
    * Contributors
    * Credit To
    * Owner

    

Add following fields and their value to be provided by the creator during creation time.


1.  **Author:**  (of the resource) - The person or organization who has authored the content. If the author herself is creating the content on DIKSHA, she can give her name. But if a different person has authored the content and do not have access to DIKSHA, the person creating the content on DIKSHA should provide the original author’s name. This is a free flowing text and is mandatory.
1.  **License** : There are two types of licenses supported on DIKSHA. They are CC-BY and Youtube. All content created on DIKSHA will by default have CC-BY 4.0 license.

| Event Name | Description | Purpose | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| Mention the event that will generate telemetry and which needs to be captured.  | Provide event details. e.g. clicking upload for textbook taxonomy  | Provide a reason why the event telemetry should be captured.  | 



Non-Functional RequirementsUse this section to capture non-functional requirements in the following table. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.    



| Performance / Responsiveness Requirements | Load/Volume Requirements | Security / Privacy Requirements | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| Provide the perfomance or the responsivenes required from the system to ensure that the Use Case is effective.  | Provide the load or volume required from the system to ensure that the Use Case is effective. | Provide security and privacy requirements for an effective Use Case  | 
|  |  |  | 



Impact on other Products/SolutionsUse this section to capture the impact of this use case on other products, solutions. To add or remove rows in the table, use the table functionality from the toolbar.    



| Product/Solution Impacted | Impact Description |
