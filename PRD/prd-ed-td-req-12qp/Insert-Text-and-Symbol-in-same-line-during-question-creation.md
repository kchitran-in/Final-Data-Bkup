 **Description**  - User to be able to add text and images/ special characters/symbols in the same line in the question editor during question creation

 **Current Limitation**  - The symbols/formula that are added gets converted into SVG format and are shown in the editor as image. The editor has limitation of not allowing Text and Image in the same line, the image is always inserted in a new line (However, text can be added as above and below the image)

 **Proposed -Â ** 

Approach 1: Contribute to the Current CK Editor to include these changes:


1. Make the default size of the symbols and special characters, same as that of text.


1. Provision for images/special characters/ symbols to be added in the same line



Approach 2: Upgrade CK Editor


1. Upgrade the CKEditor from version 13 to 25


1. Complexity, effort, dependencies are not known for this approach, for Samagra  it is complete BlackBox
