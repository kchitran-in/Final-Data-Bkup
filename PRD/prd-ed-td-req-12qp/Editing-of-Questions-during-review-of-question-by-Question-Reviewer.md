 **Use case**  - Currently, the reviewer can Accept a question or Request for changes in the question.

In addition, there should be a provision for the reviewer to make edits to the question content.

 **User Flow**  - The reviewer will get an edit option, on going to the Edit option, the question becomes editable, the reviewer makes changes, and selects the Approve and Submit button.

The reviewer can edit everything in the question, Question content, Answer content, Question Tags.

Rationale - Operationally, this feature is useful in situations where a minor spacing or spelling mistake is there in the question. In such situations, going through the complete loop of Requesting for change would create bottlenecks.

[Similar to edit provision for Question Paper Creator (Sourcing reviewer)](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRD/pages/2245427283/Editing+of+Questions+during+review+of+question+by+Question+paper+creator+Sourcing+reviewer)
