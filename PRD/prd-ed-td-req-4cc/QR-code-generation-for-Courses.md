IntroductionIn order to help the teachers who struggle to search and discover the specific course which they need to enroll, we provided a facility for teachers to scan a QR code and enroll/consume course as part of R 2.1.0. However, The QR code generation is currently being done as a back end activity by the Implementation team. Going forward, we want the State to be able to generate, download and print the QR codes on their own, without manual intervention from Implementation or any other team.
