IntroductionWhen Courses are launched in a state, there should be a mechanism for the state to monitor the health of the courses. A State Admin should be able to generate daily dashboards and present it to his/her Superiors who in turn will be able to take appropriate actions to drive the courses to completion

 **Context ** Currently, "Course Enrollment" and "Course Completion" reports are available only for the three courses that was launched by AP in 01 May 2019. These reports are generated on a daily/weekly basis and displayed on the portal for the State Admin to view. However, AP is planning to launch around 20 more courses by September 19 and Gujarat will launch around 5 courses by August 19. As the course count is going to go higher, the task of Product/Program team sharing the list of courses and batches with the Implementation/Analytics team should be avoided and the dashboard should get automatically generated based on the courses launched in the state without any manual intervention. Hence, as part of version 2,


1. The current manual activities in report generation should be completely eliminated
1. Any State should be able to view the dashboard for the respective courses it has launched

 **Note: As Courses are going to be consumed by users from more than one state, instead of the adhoc analytic team, this will have to be taken up by the Engineering team **

| State Admin, who launches online training programs, does not know about the adoption and usage of it in the State & also in each district. Hence struggles to provide timely interventions to drive the adoption and usage metrics | Online Training |  _Ability for state to view the adoption, usage and completion of training programs for each course at the state and district level_  |  _Recognition for ensuring the success of online training programs across all districts_  | 



Use Case - OverviewState should be able to monitor the online course's progress at State and District level. The below metrics need to be captured and displayed as a dashboard for the course progress monitoring


1. Total number of enrollments in the state for all courses (This should include numbers only from the respective tenant)
1. Total number of enrollments per district for a course 
1. Total number of completions in the state for all courses (This should include numbers only from the respective tenant))
1. Total number of completions per district for a course
1. Average time spent by the users for a course in the state (This should be calculated, by including numbers only from the respective tenant)
1. Average time spent by the users for a course per district in the state

Main work flow


1. View the reports for his/her state
1. View the following reports one below the other (below order) 
    1. Enrollment and Completion Report (by Course)
    1. Enrollment and Completion Report (by District)
    1. Course usage Report (By Course)
    1. Course Usage Report (By District)

    
1. View the raw data in a table view. This will be common to all the four reports (Course Name, Batch Name, Batch type (ongoing,expired), District Name,Total number of Enrollments, Total number of Completion, Average time spent)
1. Download the report as a CSV
1. View the reports for teachers who belong to the state (self signed up or state login)
1. Note:1 Users from any tenant can enroll into an open course batch. In all the reports, include only teachers who belong to the same tenant ID as the report viewer’s tenant id.

 **Data Fields** Course Name: Name of the Course launched in the state 

Batch Name: Name of the batch. There could be more than one batch for a Course

Batch type: Ongoing, Expired

District Name : Name of the District within the State, to which the users belong. This can either be derived through the IP address of the user's device (or) user's location. During SSO, there is a provision to capture the School ID through which district name is made available. For self signed up users, district name is not available. Note: For AP, district information is available for SSO users. For those users who don't have district information, this will be blank 

Total number of Enrollments: Total number of users who have enrolled into the course   

Total number of Completions: Total number of users who have completed the course (Course progress is 100%)

Total time spent: Total time spent on the course by users in the state
