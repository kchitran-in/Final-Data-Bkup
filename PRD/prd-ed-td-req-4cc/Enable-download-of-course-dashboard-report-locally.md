IntroductionCourse mentor can view the course dashboard and can also download the report as a csv file. Currently when the course mentor clicks on download, the csv file is sent to the registered email address of the course mentor. Most of the course mentors have mobile numbers but do not have active email IDs. Hence the need to allow this download on the requestors' local machine.

User Story 1 - OverviewAs a course mentor I want to be able to download course dashboard report locally so that I can apply filters and carry out data analysis around course enrollment and completion metrics.

Scenario: Course mentor navigates to course dashboard, selects the batch for which they want to view the report (in case they are assigned as mentors to multiple batches) and clicks on download.
