IntroductionCurrently, there is an existing dashboard to monitor the course progress. This dashboard has to be enhanced to include the Assessment score details of users per batch within a Course. Also there are couple of enhancements to be done to the existing course dashboard for a more user intuitive and seamless experience

When Courses are launched in a state, there should be a mechanism for the state to monitor the quality of content at question level. State would want to gauge the chapters that were easy for users to consume versus contents that were difficult. Each unit/chapter in every course in general has an Assessment associated with it Hence, one way of understanding the content quality would be to see the Assessment scores of users in each course. This would give some insights on whether the chapter was interesting/complicated/easy so that additional help/guidance may be provided to those users who are stuck in one or more chapter/unit to complete the same. Also, State would want to update the contents to make it more easy when it is launched next time

| State Admin, who launches online training programs, does not know which unit/content is complicated versus unit that is easy. Hence find it difficult to provide guidance/help to teachers who are struggling to complete the course | Online Training |  _Ability for the state to view the scores of Assessment associated with unit/s_  |  _Help/Guide teachers to complete the complicated units in the course_  |

 **System JIRAkey,summary,type,created,updated,due,assignee,reporter,priority,status,resolution2207a759-5bc8-39c5-9cd2-aa9ccc1f65ddSB-14867** 

 **Context:** 

User’s Score report for a course, was implemented as part of SB-13498. The scores were calculated for question set/s and the latest attempted score was displayed as part of the report.

However now that, a new content type called "Self-Assess” has been introduced, there are some minor changes to done as part of the report. The scores of “Question set” will no more be included as part of the Score report. Instead, the scores of content type “Self-Assess” alone will be included as part of the Score report

As a State Admin, I would want to have access to scores of self assessment/s of all users within a batch of a course, So that I can get some insights on the quality of the contents within a course

 **Acceptance criteria:** 

 **Pre-conditions:** 


1. The logged in user has access to view course dashboard


1. Batch is not expired


1. User has clicked "Score Report"



 **Acceptance criteria:** 

Verify that:


1. The report gets downloaded as a CSV file


1. The score of content type "Self-Assess” alone are considered in the score calculation

1. The below information are displayed as part of the Score report


    1. External ID, User ID, User Name, Email Address, Mobile Number, Organisation Name, District Name, School name (The generic information of the user that gets displayed in the report remains the same)


    1. Self Assess Name - The score of the Assessment is displayed (A course can have one or multiple self assessments, though in reality there could be only one. If there is more than one Assessment, scores of all the Assessments are displayed)


    1. Total Score - This is the sum of all Self Assess scores.



    
1. Score for a Self assessment is always the best score

## User Story 4 - Assessment Score to show in % in the CSV
 **JIRA Ticket ID** 

 **System JIRAkey,summary,type,created,updated,due,assignee,reporter,priority,status,resolution2207a759-5bc8-39c5-9cd2-aa9ccc1f65ddSB-16674** 

 **Context** 

The current Score report when downloaded converts the text/score into date format. Also, we have the actual score and the maximum score displayed one below the other (eg: 4/10), which is not a very good user experience. The State would want to do various computations with the scores to make timely and meaningful decisions. Hence this score information needs to be displayed in %, so that the State Admin can interpret the score easily

 **As a State Admin, I would want the score to be displayed in %, So that it is easier for me to interpret easily and make meaningful decisions** 

 **Pre-conditions** 


1. Logged in user has access to view Dashboard
1. Batch is selected
1. User has clicked "Score Report"

 **Acceptance criteria** 

 **Verify that** 

Main workflow


1. The user's individual Assessment score is displayed in percentage


    1. Formula - (Assessment score/Max Score)\*100



    
1. The user's total score is displayed in percentage


    1. Formula - (Sum of all Assessment scores/Sum of all Max scores)\*100



    

Exceptional workflow


1. The earlier score reports generated in x/y format should also get converted and rounded off
