IntroductionAP would be launching 3 online courses in the last week of May for their teachers. All these teachers would be on-boarded by the end of March and would use SSO to access DIKSHA. State has articulated the need to have a dashboard which the state admins can use to monitor the health of this program. State admin would in-turn present these dashboards to their higher ups (Director & Commissioner).This is needed to be enabled and handed over to the state by 25th May '19.

| State Admin, who is launching online training programs, does not have know about the adoption and usage of the online training program and hence struggles to provide timely interventions to drive the adoption and usage metrics | Online Training |  _Ability for state to view the adoption, usage and completion of training programs launched by them_  |  _Recognition for ensuring the success of online training programs_  | 



Use Case - OverviewProvide information to the state to monitor the below metrics at state, district & course level:

a) program adoption (measured by course enrollments) and

b) course usage (measured by course completions & avg time spent)

Hence the need to capture the below information:

a) total no. of courses launched

b) total no. of enrollments in these courses (this should include numbers only from the respective tenant)

c) total no. of completions (this should include numbers only from the respective tenant)

d) average time spent (this should be calculated include numbers only from the respective tenant)
