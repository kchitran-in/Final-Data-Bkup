IntroductionResources today can be used independently or linked to a Course for consumption. Sometimes it is noticed that the course name and resource name are the same and teachers wrongly consume the resource and assume that the course has been completed. In this case, the teacher actually completed consuming a Resource and not a Course. This causes confusion among the teachers. Also, resources meant to be part of a Course, some times loses the continuity and context when consumed as a Resource. Hence the best way to handle this would be to make a resource either available to all or course creators based on the intent
